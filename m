Interesting.
I was thinking of some malicious specifically crafted configurations
with very low limit and particular pattern of allocations. Also what
if there is just 1 process (current)? Is it possible to kill and
reclaim the current process when a thread is stuck in the middle of
the kernel on a kmalloc?
Also I see e.g.:
        Tasks with the OOM protection (oom_score_adj set to -1000)
        are treated as an exception and are never killed.

I am not an expert on this either, but I think it may be hard to fight
with a specifically crafted attack.

Even better to put this into code as a predicate function that fault
injection will use. It will also serve as precise up-to-date
documentation.
