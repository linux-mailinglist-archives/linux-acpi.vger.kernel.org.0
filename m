Yes, my point of 2) is targeting the following:
a) MS should be notified
b) MS must try very hard to avoid similar problems in the future, they
very well may discuss the matters in ASWG with other companies
c) the spec will be fixed for the future versions, while the current
one will live for the backward compatibility only

Frankly I'm a bit frustrated that it's not the first time MS violates
the ACPI spec, while being a member of ASWG.
