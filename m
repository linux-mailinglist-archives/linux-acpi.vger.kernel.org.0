It concerns me if minimising the subset of the C language that the 
kernel uses is achieved by converting more of the kernel to a 
not-quite-C language that is not formally specified anywhere, by 
prematurely adopting newly-invented compiler options that clearly don't 
work properly (the GCC warning message quoted above may as well be 
"error: giraffes are not purple" for all the sense it makes.)

 From your security standpoint (and believe me, I really do have faith 
in your expertise here), which of these sounds better:

1: Being able to audit code based on well-defined language semantics

2: Playing whack-a-mole as issues are discovered empirically.

3: Neither of the above, but a warm fuzzy feeling because hey someone 
said "security" in a commit message.

AFAICS you're effectively voting against #1, and the examples you've 
given demonstrate that #2 is nowhere near reliable enough either, so 
where does that leave us WRT actual secure and robust code in Linux?

In fairness I'd have no objection to that patch if it came with a 
convincing justification, but that is so far very much lacking. My aim 
here is not to be a change-averse Luddite, but to try to find a 
compromise where I can actually have some confidence in such changes 
being made. Let's not start pretending that 3 100ml bottles of shampoo 
are somehow "safer" than a 300ml bottle of shampoo...

Thanks,
Robin.
