FYI, the corresponding commit for ALSA part is destined for 5.4
kernel: 
  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tiwai/sound.git/commit/?id=ade49db337a9d44ac5835cfce1ee873549011b27

BTW, Nouveau should suffer from the same problem.  The patch to add
the audio component support is found at:
  https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/319131/
