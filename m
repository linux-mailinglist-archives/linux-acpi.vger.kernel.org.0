Valid fix for me as well, we had a firmware bug which reported the
numbers of ID as 1 when we only have one ID mapping, so remove the
check is fine for the old firmware, but to make it sure, we need some
test before give it a pass.

I need some time to get it properly tested on two versions of firmware,
and get the test machine properly setup, please allow me give the
feedback next week.

Thanks
