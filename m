This is my _opinion_ based on what I've heard of some other IP 
integration issues, and what i've seen poking at this one from the 
perspective of a SW guy rather than a HW guy. So, basically worthless. 
But, you should consider that most of these cores/interconnects aren't 
aware of PCIe completion semantics so its the root ports responsibility 
to say, gracefully translate a non-posted write that doesn't have a 
completion for the interconnects its attached to, rather than tripping 
something generic like a SLVERR.

Anyway, for this I would poke around the pile of exception registers, 
with your specific processors manual handy because a lot of them are 
implementation defined.
