I don't remember the details anymore but looking at the commit log of my
"fix" attempt here:

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=287661

The EFI memory map actually seems to consists of several entries that somehow
are merged by something (I think this is the EFI stub but not sure). Booting
with "efi=debug" may help us to understand this further (or not).

On that Yoga system, this:

  [Reserved           |   |  |  |  |  |  |  | |   |WB|WT|WC|UC] range=[0x000000002bc50000-0x000000003fffffff] (323MB)
  [Reserved           |   |  |  |  |  |  |  | |   |WB|  |  |UC] range=[0x0000000040000000-0x0000000040ffffff] (16MB)
  [Reserved           |   |  |  |  |  |  |  | |   |  |  |  |  ] range=[0x0000000041000000-0x00000000453fffff] (68MB)
  [Memory Mapped I/O  |RUN|  |  |  |  |  |  | |   |  |  |  |UC] range=[0x0000000045400000-0x00000000cfffffff] (2220MB)

became this:

  BIOS-e820: [mem 0x000000002bc50000-0x00000000cfffffff] reserved

Since the area (0x45400000-0xcfffffff) is marked as MMIO I think maybe we can
simply skip those areas in arch_remove_reservations() or so?

I may be missing a lots of details, though. ;-)
