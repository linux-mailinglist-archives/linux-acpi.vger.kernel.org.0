Not sure how that would look like, so I will hold off my comments on this
topic. But we really should strive towards auto-discovery as much as possible.

I guess so. I understand sometimes we need to consider multiple target OS.

Ideally, we should manage with dynamic buffers. But I do understand the
reasons why we may need static curve outs. I prefer the ffa client driver
take care of that without needing to build FF-A bindings just for that.

I will wait and see how all these shape up (soon ?)
