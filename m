Yeah.  I had a patch to remove this which lead me into the rabbit
hole your described later.  A few patches in I decided to give up
and just do the trivial move.  But it probably makes sense to pick
up at least the two trivial dead code removal patches..

I sent a ping to the omap maintainers earlier this week to ask for that :)

Yes,  pretty much all of this should eventually go away.  I just don't
want to bock the ranges work on all kinds of random arm cleanups..
