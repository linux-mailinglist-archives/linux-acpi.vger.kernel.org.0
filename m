We don't know if we'll need that in the future, and that's the point.

Right now we can't say for sure if DT can even supply the details that
we need from _PLD. I don't think we can at the moment even say are the
DT guys willing to support this at all.

To play it safe, I would just supply the needed _PLD fields as part of
the ACPI device nodes (under /sys/bus/acpi). There we can guarantee
that we'll always be able to supply all the information in the _PDL if
needed. Since we would add these to the ACPI nodes, it would be
crystal clear to the userspace that this information is only available
on ACPI platforms.

Then if, and only if, we know that DT can supply the same information
(at least to some of it) I would start thinking about the alternative
interface to this information that we make part of the actual devices.
Since at this point we have already the primary ACPI specific
interface to this same information that guarantees that it can supply
all the details if necessary, we don't have to worry about having to
be able to do the same with this new interface. This interface can
just expose the common details that we know for sure that both ACPI
and DT can always supply.
