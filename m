first of all thank you very much for this very profound analysis.

This is really what I was asking for and you probably went even a step
deeper than that. Very appreciated.

What we should do instead of doing a wholesale let's ignore WBINVD is to
have a separate function/macro:

 ACPI_FLUSH_CPU_CACHE_PHYS()

and invoke that from the functions which are considered to be safe.

That would default to ACPI_FLUSH_CPU_CACHE() for other architecures
obviously.

Then you can rightfully do:

#define ACPI_FLUSH_CPU_CACHE_PHYS()     \
        if (!cpu_feature_enabled(XXX))	\
        	wbinvd();               \              
                
where $XXX might be FEATURE_TDX_GUEST for paranoia sake and then
extended to X86_FEATURE_HYPERVISOR if everyone agrees.

Then you have the #VE handler which just acts on any other wbinvd
invocation via warn, panic, whatever, no?

Thanks,

        tglx
