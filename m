You are referring to a 2000 line patch so it is not 100% clear where
to look tbh.

That refers to a 'memory-allocation' node, right? How does that relate
to the 'reserved-memory' node?

And crucially, how does this clarify in which way "runtime-code" and
"runtime-data" reservations are being used?

Since the very beginning of this discussion, I have been asking
repeatedly for examples that describe the wider context in which these
reservations are used. The "runtime" into runtime-code and
runtime-data means that these regions have a special significance to
the operating system, not just to the next bootloader stage. So I want
to understand exactly why it is necessary to describe these regions in
a way where the operating system might be expected to interpret this
information and act upon it.
