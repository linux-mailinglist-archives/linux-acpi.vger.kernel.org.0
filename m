That's OK.  It just means that these devices are not power-manageable
via ACPI on the platforms in question, but the MID PCI PM code is
present in the kernel, so we don't need analogous code in AML in the
ACPI tables.

My point is that something like the v2 of this patch series
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-acpi/1800633.tdWV9SEqCh@kreacher/T/#m1ec249724a5ad5ad358b0ed8e149e3926934955d)
is needed to prevent ACPI from overtaking the PM for the PCI devices
on the platform once we've decided to use the MID PM for them.

Now, if it is necessary to use ACPI PM for some devices and the MID PM
for other devices on the same platform, the latter needs to grow a
meaningful "power manageable" function that needs to be used in the
code as appropriate.
