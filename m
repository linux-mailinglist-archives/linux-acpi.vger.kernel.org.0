There's already an existing dmi_check_system() in similar
acpi_turn_off_unused_power_resources() function.

This function is called just once during system wake so it is
hardly a hot path.
In any case, that hp_eb_gp12pxp_quirk flag initialization part
could be easily moved to some init function that's run just once
during system boot.

Then the whole overhead on other systems amounts to hp_eb_gp12pxp_quirk
flag comparison as resource_is_gp12pxp() won't be called on them
due to && operator short-circuit evaluation behavior.

This platform supports just s2idle - no S3 support there, so that's
not a problem.

I did a quick test with the WWAN modem driver that's built into the kernel
and in the case of 100% successful hibernation the modem indeed works after
resume.

But in case of aborted (or failed) hibernation it is still broken
(this scenario can be simulated easily by writing to /sys/power/pm_test).

While a failed hibernation entry might sound like a corner case in practice
it is far from it unfortunately - I start to experience it regularly after
about 2 weeks of uptime when the machine RAM usage starts to exceed 50%
(I start to get memory allocation failures during hibernation as that other
50% of RAM gets used by AFAIK snapshot copy of the memory).

Other things, like for example btrfs scrub running in background, or active
wake event may also cause failed hibernation entry.

What's worse, even successful hibernation and restore after that doesn't
bring back the modem to the working state - a clean reboot of the machine
is necessary for that.

It's also worth noting that the root cause of the problem is firmware bug
that reports this power resource as OFF via "_STA" but does not allow turning
it ON via just "_ON" method call so that's what we probably should be fixing.

I've updated that laptop BIOS to the latest version but sadly it does not
seem to bring any DSDT changes with respect to the previous one.

Thanks,
Maciej
