Right,

I think this was similar to a conversation we had internally, which was 
basically to detect the PCIe extended capability and export a 'steering' 
entry in sysfs on each PCIe device which can take a logical cpu/cache 
value, translate those on write to the ACPI cpu/cache id's, make the 
firmware call, then directly update the PCIe device's capability with 
the result. This also leaves the door open for future 
cpu/cache->steering tag translation methods to transparently replace the 
_DSM call while leaving the userspace API the same.
