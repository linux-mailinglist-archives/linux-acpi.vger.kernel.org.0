Hmm.  I'm really not a fan of checks like this that aren't connected
to an actual property of the platform.  The Intel Vendor ID tells us
nothing about what the actual problem is, which makes it really hard
to maintain in the future.  It's also very AMD- and Intel-centric,
when this code is ostensibly arch-agnostic, so this potentially
regresses ARM64, RISC-V, powerpc, etc.

It's bad enough that we check for 2015.  A BIOS security update to a
2014 platform will break things, even though the update has nothing to
do with D3.  We're stuck with that one, and it's old enough that maybe
it won't bite us any more, but I hate to add more.

The list of conditions in pci_bridge_d3_possible() is a pretty good
clue that we don't really know what we're doing, and all we can do is
find configurations that happen to work.  

I don't have any better suggestions, other than that this should be
described somehow via ACPI (and not in vendor-specific stuff like
PNP0D80).
