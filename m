ACPI reclaim is a policy, not a purpose. This memory could contain
many different things.

These are also policies. They can be inferred from the purpose.

I understand that this binding targets firmware<->firmware rather than
firmware<->OS, which makes it much more difficult to keep it both
generic and sufficiently descriptive.

However, I still feel that all the overlap with UEFI memory types is
not what we want here. UEFI knows how to manage its own memory map,
what it needs to know is what memory is already in use and for which
exact purpose. Whether or not that implies that the memory can be
freed at some point or can be mapped or not should follow from that.
