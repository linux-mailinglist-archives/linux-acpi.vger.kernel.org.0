I will change it in next version.

Sorry for the typo. Please refer to the following:
On an ACPI system, ACPI is initialized very early from a subsys_initcall,
while SDEI is not ready until a *subsys_initcall_sync*. More seriously,
the kernel is *unable* to handle and report errors until the GHES is
initialized by device_initcall().

Sorry for typos, they will be corrected in next version.

The SDEI driver provides functions (e.g. apei_sdei_register_ghes,
apei_sdei_unregister_ghes) to register or unregister event callback for
dispatcher in firmware. When the GHES driver probing, it registers the
corresponding callback according to the notification type specified by
generic hardware error source. If the GHES notification type is SDEI, the
GHES driver will call apei_sdei_register_ghes to register event call.

When the firmware emits an event, it migrates the handling of the event
into the kernel at the registered entry-point __sdei_asm_handler. And
finally, the kernel will call the registered event callback and return
status_code to indicate the status of event handling. SDEI_EV_FAILED
indicates that the kernel failed to handle the event.

Consequently, when an error occurs during the kernel booting, the kernel is
unable to handle and report errors until the GHES driver is initialized by
device_initcall(), in which the event callback is registered.

Therefore, we propose to move sdei_init and ghes_init ahead as far as
possible on kernel bootup. Other notification types, such as
acpi_hed_driver should also be applied, which is not mentioned in this patch.


> What is SDEI?  Please provide a citation to whatever spec is relevant.
The Software Delegated Exception Interface (SDEI) is an ARM standard
for registering callbacks from the platform firmware into the OS. Please
refer to the [documentation](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0054/a)
for more details.

From commmit e147133a42cb (ACPI / APEI: Make hest.c manage the estatus
memory pool) was merged, ghes_init() relies on acpi_hest_init() to manage
the estatus memory pool. On the other hand, ghes_init() relies on
sdei_init() to detect the SDEI version and the framework for registering
and unregistering events. By the way, I don't figure out why acpi_hest_init
is called in acpi_pci_root_init, it don't rely on any other thing. May it
could be moved further, following acpi_iort_init in acpi_init.

sdei_init() relies on ACPI table which is initialized subsys_initcall():
acpi_init(), acpi_bus_init(), acpi_load_tables(), acpi_tb_laod_namespace().
May it should be also moved further, after acpi_load_tables.

I will change sdei_init in next version like ghes_init:
	#ifdef CONFIG_ARM_SDE_INTERFACE
	int __init sdei_init(void);
	#else
	static inline int sdei_init(void) { return 0; }
	#endif

Thank you, agree that:)

Will change it if we reach an agreement that we shoud move sdei_init
and ghes_init ahead.
