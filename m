Note this provides complete support for our usecase on an ARM server using
Hardware Reduced ACPI and adds appropriate place for an RCEC driver to hook
if someone else cares to write one, either for firmware first handling on
non Hardware Reduced ACPI or for kernel first AER handling.

For Root Complex integrated End Points (RCiEPs) there is no root port to
discover and hence we cannot walk the bus from the root port to do
appropriate resets.

The PCI specification provides Root Complex Event Collectors to deal with
this circumstance.  These are peer RCiEPs that provide (amongst other
things) collection + interrupt facilities for AER reporting for a set of
RCiEPs in the same root complex.

In the case of a Hardware Reduced ACPI platform, the AER errors are
reported via a GHESv2 path using CPER records as defined in the UEFI
specification.  These are intended to provide complete information and
appropriate hand shake in a fashion that does not require a specific form
of error reporting hardware.  This is contrast to AER handling via the
various HEST entries for PCI Root Port and PCI Device etc where we do
require direct access to the RCEC.

As such my interpretation of the spec is that a Reduced Hardware ACPI
platform should not access the RCEC from the OS at all during AER handling,
and in fact is welcome to use non standard hardware interfaces to provide
the equivalent functionality in any fashion it wishes (as all hidden beind
the firmware).

Hence I am making the provision of an RCEC optional.

The aim of the rest of the code was to replicate the actions that would
have occurred if this had been an EP below a root port. Some of them make
absolutely no sense, but I hope this RFC can start a discussion on what
we should be doing under these circumstances.

It probably makes sense to pull this new block of code out to a separate
function but for the RFC I've left it in place to keep it next to the
existing path.

It appears that the current kernel first code does not support detecting
the multiple error bits being set in the root port error status register.
This seems like a limitation both the normal EP / Root Port case and
for RCiEPs.
