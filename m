The path to this hypothetical 3a:00.0 device is:

  PCI host bridge to bus 0000:00
  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [io  0x0000-0x0cf7 window]
  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [io  0x0d00-0xffff window]
  00:1b.0: Root Port to [bus 02-3a]
  02:00.0: Switch Upstream Port to [bus 03-3a]
  03:02.0: Switch Downstream Port to [bus 3a]
  3a:00.0: reg 0x10: [io  0x????-0x????]

None of the bridges (00:1b.0, 02:00.0, 03:02.0) currently has an open
I/O window, but there's space available on bus 00 and windows *could*
be opened.

I guess it comes down to that ordering problem: this Notify() and
acpiphp_native_scan_bridge() happens before pnp/system.c reserves
things, so we don't yet know what space is actually available.

If firmware had configured I/O windows for these bridges, 3a:00.0
would probably work.  But it doesn't seem right that we would depend
on that firmware configuration.
