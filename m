Hi Miguel,

Great to see an attempt to keep this moving. My apologies that I've been rather
quiet on this so far this cycle - a few things came up that ended up more urgent :(

In the thread you link there was a discussion on whether to stub out these functions
as a possible way forwards. I did some analysis of what was going on in 

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/20240322185327.00002416@Huawei.com/

and my conclusion was that to do so would mostly be misleading.
The flows for make present and make enabled are and should be different
(though not as different as they were in v4!)

Jonathan
