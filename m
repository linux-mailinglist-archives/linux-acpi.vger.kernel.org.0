It's a very good point. I'll send a separate patch for this with added
information in "3.1 CPU capacity" in sched-capacity.rst. I'll send this
separate and not with the rebase that Rafael requested to avoid
confusing things.

The freq_factor is only used for DT systems where one provides
"capacity-dmips-mhz" in DT. This entry actually represents DMIPS/MHz.

So the freq_factor, set to:

per_cpu(freq_factor, cpu) = policy->cpuinfo.max_freq / 1000;

is used to obtain the performance at the maximum frequency, basically
DMIPS = (Dhrystone) million instructions per second, by multiplying this
raw value from DT with the freq_factor. After this, all these value for
each CPU type are normalized on a scale [0, 1024], resulting in what we
call CPU capacity.

For ACPI systems freq_factor will have the default value of 1 when we
call topology_normalize_cpu_scale(), as the performance value obtained
from _CPC is already representative for the highest frequency of the CPU
and not performance/Hz as we get from DT. Therefore, we are not and
should not use a freq_factor here.

Hopefully I understood your question correctly.

Thanks,
Ionela.
