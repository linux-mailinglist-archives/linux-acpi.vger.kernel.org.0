Subject: [PATCH 1/6] PM: ACPI/PCI: Resume all devices during hibernation

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

Both the PCI bus type and the ACPI PM domain avoid resuming
runtime-suspended devices with DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND set during
hibernation (before creating the snapshot image of system memory),
but that turns out to be a mistake.  It leads to functional issues
and adds complexity that's hard to justify.

For this reason, resume all runtime-suspended PCI devices and all
devices in the ACPI PM domains before creating a snapshot image of
system memory during hibernation.

Fixes: 05087360fd7a (ACPI / PM: Take SMART_SUSPEND driver flag into account)
Fixes: c4b65157aeef (PCI / PM: Take SMART_SUSPEND driver flag into account)
