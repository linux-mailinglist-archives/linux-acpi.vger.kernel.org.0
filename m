Yes we can add a more specific match higher up in the pci_crs_quirks[]
array and then use a callback which returns non 0 to make
dmi_check_system() abort checking the rest of the array.

Ok, so what I'm reading between the lines here is that despite
the concerns which I've voiced you want to continue with
disabling e820 clipping by default for machines with a
DMI_BIOS_DATE year of 2023 or newer. Which is fine by me I
just wanted to get my concerns out there.

I'm almost done prepping a v8 now. I had to do some other
stuff and spend a lot of time checking dmesg output for
all the Lenovo *IIL* models.

For v8 I've also added a quirk for the Acer model you pointed
me to in another email.

Regards,

Hans
