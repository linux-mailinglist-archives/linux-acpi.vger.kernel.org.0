Agreed, do you have a suggestion how to do that ? I've been looking at this but I've gotten a bit lost in all the layers of ioapic code.

It looks like we need to add a flag to acpi_register_gsi() for it to register a gsi while keeping the IOAPIC settings as is (or a new function) but it is not clear to me how to implement this.

An alternative method would be to call irq_get_trigger_type() for IRQ 1 and use that for the IRQ trigger info when calling acpi_register_gsi(), but I think we need to have the IRQ registered / added to the IRQ domain first ?

Regards,

Hans
