It is more than just one driver, we have vfio-pci, idpf, pci-pf-stub
and possible nvme driver.
The change needs to happen in the PCI enumeration and probing as well,
that is outside of the driver code.

In theory all the devices can be liveupdate preserved. But now we only
support PCI.
I can look into containing the change in PCI only and not touching the
device struct if that is what you mean. I recall I tried that
previously and failed because bus->bridge is a device struct rather
than pci_dev or pci_host_bridge. I can try harder not to touch device
structs. Patch will be bigger and more complex than this right now.
But at least the damage is limited to PCI only if successful.

I understand your concerns. I was wishing one day all devices could
support liveupdate, but that is not the case right now.

Not a single driver. It is the whole PCI core. Or in your book the
whole PCI is just one single driver?

OK. Let me try that PCI only approach again and try it harder. I will
report back.

Thanks for the feedback.
