Right, the cm32181 code needs access to the CPM0 and CPM1 ACPI
objects, which requires access to the fwnode.

On systems where there are 2 resources, the driver only attaches
to the second resouce. It does detect when it gets called for
the first resource (it detects the ARA address) and then returns
-ENODEV.

Another approach might be for the driver to call i2c_acpi_new_device
itself when it detects the ARA address, but that is quite ugly, then
we get:

-ACPI subsys instantiates i2c-client
  -cm32181_probe
   -cm32181_probe instantiates i2c-client for second resource
    -cm32181 probe (for second resource)
    -cm32181 probe returns 0
   -cm32181 probe returns -ENODEV

So the end result is the same (2 clients instantiated, one
bound to the cm32181 driver). But the nested probe calls to me
look quite ugly and since this solution actually still does
multi-instantiation using i2c-multi-inst seems like the more
clean solution to me.

Note that we need to likely solve the fwnode passing problem
sooner or later anyways. One of these days a driver for an
i2c-client instantiated by the i2c-multi-inst code is going
to need access to some methods or objects from the ACPI
device.

Since you do not like the PASS_FWNODE flag, one solution
would be this change:

diff --git a/drivers/i2c/i2c-core-base.c b/drivers/i2c/i2c-core-base.c
index a66912782064..365864e8bfd5 100644

+		client->irq = 0;
+
  	/*
  	 * An I2C ID table is not mandatory, if and only if, a suitable OF
  	 * or ACPI ID table is supplied for the probing device.


This allows us to set board_info.irq to -ENOENT in the i2c-multi-inst
code, causing the core to skip trying to get the irq from the fwnode
itself, while still making drivers see 0 as irq value (which they
expect when there is no irq).

With this change i2c-multi-inst can pass the fwnode unconditionally.

Regards,

Hans
