This is fine AFAICS.

The const parameter means that to_of_node() will not update the memory
pointed to by it, which is correct.

The value returned by it may be used by its caller in whatever way
they like, because the caller has no obligation to preserve the memory
pointed to by it, unless they've also received that pointer with the
const qualifier, but then they need to know how it is related to the
to_of_node() return value and what to do with it.

IOW, to_of_node() has no information on its caller's obligations with
respect to the memory pointed to by its argument, so it is OK for it
to return a non-const result.  Moreover, if it had done otherwise, it
might have created an obligation for the caller that didn't exist
before.

I'm not sure what you mean here, sorry.
