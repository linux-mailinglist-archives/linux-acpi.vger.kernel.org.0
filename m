The main point to me is that the new code should work if the platform
firmware messes things up somewhat (but not too much) while the old
code fails in those cases.

There is also an assumption in the current code that setting error
bits in the return buffer means hard failures while it follows from
the spec (although not really clearly, which is a problem by itself)
that what matters is what bits are set in the return feature masks.
I'll add some information related to this to the changelog.

That of course is also possible.

Well, it doesn't actually scream, but that would be a matter of
changing the log level.
