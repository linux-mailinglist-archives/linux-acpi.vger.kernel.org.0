FWIW, the usual drivers/pci style is to order the decls in the order
the variables are used in the code.  But this isn't drivers/pci, so
it's up to you.  I only noticed because changing the order made the
diff bigger than it needed to be.

-ENXIO is fine with me.  I just don't see it as often so I don't
really know what it is.
