Yes, I have, and that's because of the realization that the
requirements may differ depending on whether or not there is a device
(USB or other) enabled to wake up the system from sleep under the Root
Port in question.

Essentially, the problem is that wakeup doesn't work and the
investigation led to the Root Port's power state when suspended, but
that power state only appears to be too deep for the wakeup to work
and not in general.

IIUC, the port can be safely programmed into D3hot and then back to D0
and that works as long as there are no wakeup devices under it (Mario,
please correct me if that's not the case).

Now, when a USB device on the bus segment under the port is configured
for system wakeup, it needs to be able to trigger a wake interrupt
when the system is in the sleep state.  That wake interrupt is not
generated by the USB wakeup device itself, but by the USB controller
handling it.  The USB controller is a PCIe device, so in order to
generate a wake interrupt it needs the link to its parent port to be
up unless it is capable of generating PMEs from D3cold (which only is
the case when it is connected to a separate wake power source and that
is indicated by setting the corresponding bit in its PM Capabilities
Register).  If that is not the case, and its parent port is programmed
into D3hot, that may cause the link between them to go down and so the
wake interrupt cannot be generated.  This means that the port which is
generally allowed to go into D3hot (because why not), may not be
allowed to do so if system wakeup devices are present under it and
that appears to be the missing piece to me.
