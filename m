I have heard back from the X1C2 user, he does not have access to
the machine atm he will get back to me in a couple of days.

I don't really expect any surprises there though, so given where
we are in the kernel-cycle and that we already have confirmation
that it fixes the ideapad touchpad issues I think we should move
forward with this patch-set now.

Rafael, can you drop my variant of this patch?  (this series is
a cleaner implementation of basically the same method to fix
things)

Bjorn, I assume you will merge this series through your tree?

Regards,

Hans
