Hi All.

Absolutely agree. I'm guessing RAS2 was previous go at fixing RASF though I haven't
done the archaeology.

Agreed. One aspect I'd love to see improved is expanded discoverability of what
the hardware can do.

Feel free to reach out if you want some early input on this. Are you thinking
a code first proposal?  If you think doing this through the standards body is a good idea
then perhaps message back here so we know when to look for further proposals in mantis.

Thanks,
