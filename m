From: "Rafael J. Wysocki" <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

The ACPICA's strategy with respect to the handling of memory mappings
associated with memory operation regions is to avoid mapping the
entire region at once which may be problematic at least in principle
(for example, it may lead to conflicts with overlapping mappings
having different attributes created by drivers).  It may also be
wasteful, because memory opregions on some systems take up vast
chunks of address space while the fields in those regions actually
accessed by AML are sparsely distributed.

For this reason, a one-page "window" is mapped for a given opregion
on the first memory access through it and if that "window" does not
cover an address range accessed through that opregion subsequently,
it is unmapped and a new "window" is mapped to replace it.  Next,
if the new "window" is not sufficient to acess memory through the
opregion in question in the future, it will be replaced with yet
another "window" and so on.  That may lead to a suboptimal sequence
of memory mapping and unmapping operations, for example if two fields
in one opregion separated from each other by a sufficiently wide
chunk of unused address space are accessed in an alternating pattern.

The situation may still be suboptimal if the deferred unmapping
introduced previously is supported by the OS layer.  For instance,
the alternating memory access pattern mentioned above may produce
a relatively long list of mappings to release with substantial
duplication among the entries in it, which could be avoided if
acpi_ex_system_memory_space_handler() did not release the mapping
used by it previously as soon as the current access was not covered
by it.

In order to improve that, modify acpi_ex_system_memory_space_handler()
to preserve all of the memory mappings created by it until the memory
regions associated with them go away.

Accordingly, update acpi_ev_system_memory_region_setup() to unmap all
memory associated with memory opregions that go away.
