I'll say it again. "boot" and "runtime" on their own could mean about
anything, but the usage here is clearly tied to UEFI (or the EDK2
implementation) and its meaning of boot and runtime. So the naming
needs to reflect that.

The kernel will process /reserved-memory for UEFI boot, so the
expectation is anything in the EFI memory map is not present there. An
annotation to ignore some nodes would require going back in time or
accepting 2 sources of truth on existing OS.

The only way ATM is including a schema or not when running validation
on a DT for a particular boot phase. Include the schema in the project
that wants to use these nodes and don't include it in cases that don't
use it. I don't see a reason why this needs to be in dtschema.
