As someone who finds raw dumping of ACPI tables extremely helpful in every
day use for debugging of some of our 'interesting' hardware, I know I'm going
to end up carrying that element locally anyway.  I don't have a particular
problem doing so if we decide to not to upstream it.

Much like the ACPI table dumping, it's not an interface you expect userspace
to ever use and I fully agree that we should expose things properly as you
describe.

Short term my interest here is to get the DOE code upstream as step 1 of
moving to a full solution.  The printing and dumping is really just PoC element
to prove out the interface.  Any issue with putting the prints under _dbg()?
