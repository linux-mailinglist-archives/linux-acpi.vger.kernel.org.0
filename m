Changes since v7:
- This is mostly a resend to get it refreshed in Ingo's inbox for v5.5
  consideration. It picks up a Reviewed-by on patch4 from Ard, has a
  minor cosmetic rebase on v5.4-rc6 with no other changes, it merges
  cleanly with tip/master, and is still passing the test case described in
  the final patch, but development is otherwise idle over the past 3
  weeks.

Merge notes:

Hi Ingo,

This is ready to go as far as I'm concerned. Please consider merging, or
acking for Rafael to take, or of course naking if something looks off.
Rafael had threatened to start taking the standalone ACPI bits through
his tree, but I have yet to any movement on that in his 'linux-next' or
'bleeding-edge' tree.

The EFI 2.8 Specification [2] introduces the EFI_MEMORY_SP ("specific
purpose") memory attribute. This attribute bit replaces the deprecated
ACPI HMAT "reservation hint" that was introduced in ACPI 6.2 and removed
in ACPI 6.3.

Given the increasing diversity of memory types that might be advertised
to the operating system, there is a need for platform firmware to hint
which memory ranges are free for the OS to use as general purpose memory
and which ranges are intended for application specific usage. For
example, an application with prior knowledge of the platform may expect
to be able to exclusively allocate a precious / limited pool of high
bandwidth memory. Alternatively, for the general purpose case, the
operating system may want to make the memory available on a best effort
basis as a unique numa-node with performance properties by the new
CONFIG_HMEM_REPORTING [3] facility.

In support of optionally allowing either application-exclusive and
core-kernel-mm managed access to differentiated memory, claim
EFI_MEMORY_SP ranges for exposure as "soft reserved" and assigned to a
device-dax instance by default. Such instances can be directly owned /
mapped by a platform-topology-aware application. Alternatively, with the
new kmem facility [4], the administrator has the option to instead
designate that those memory ranges be hot-added to the core-kernel-mm as
a unique memory numa-node. In short, allow for the decision about what
software agent manages soft-reserved memory to be made at runtime.

The patches build on the new HMAT+HMEM_REPORTING facilities merged
for v5.2-rc1. The implementation is tested with qemu emulation of HMAT
[5] plus the efi_fake_mem facility for applying the EFI_MEMORY_SP
attribute. Specific details on reproducing the test configuration are in
patch 12.
