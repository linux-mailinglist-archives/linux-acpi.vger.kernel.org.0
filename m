Hm, why not simply call pcibios_enable_device() from pciback?  What
you are doing here using the hypercalls is a backdoor into what's done
automatically by Xen on IO-APIC accesses by a PVH dom0.

It will be much more natural for the PVH dom0 model to simply use the
native way to configure and unmask the IO-APIC pin, and that would
correctly setup the triggering/polarity and bind it to dom0 without
requiring the usage of any hypercalls.

Is that an issue since in that case the gsi will get mapped and bound
to dom0?

Otherwise I would prefer if the gsi is just configured from pciback
(PHYSDEVOP_setup_gsi) but not mapped, as allowing a PVH dom0 to map
interrupts using PHYSDEVOP_{,un}map_pirq to itself introduces a new
interface to manage interrupts that clashes with the native way that a
PVH dom0 uses.

Thanks, Roger.
