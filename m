Subject: [RFT][PATCH v2 3/4] ACPICA: Preserve memory opregion mappings if supported by OS

From: "Rafael J. Wysocki" <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

The ACPICA's strategy with respect to the handling of memory mappings
associated with memory operation regions is to avoid mapping the
entire region at once which may be problematic at least in principle
(for example, it may lead to conflicts with overlapping mappings
having different attributes created by drivers).  It may also be
wasteful, because memory opregions on some systems take up vast
chunks of address space while the fields in those regions actually
accessed by AML are sparsely distributed.

For this reason, a one-page "window" is mapped for a given opregion
on the first memory access through it and if that "window" does not
cover an address range accessed through that opregion subsequently,
it is unmapped and a new "window" is mapped to replace it.  Next,
if the new "window" is not sufficient to access memory through the
opregion in question in the future, it will be replaced with yet
another "window" and so on.  That may lead to a suboptimal sequence
of memory mapping and unmapping operations, for example if two fields
in one opregion separated from each other by a sufficiently wide
chunk of unused address space are accessed in an alternating pattern.

The situation may still be suboptimal if the deferred unmapping
introduced previously is supported by the OS layer.  For instance,
the alternating memory access pattern mentioned above may produce
a relatively long list of mappings to release with substantial
duplication among the entries in it, which could be avoided if
acpi_ex_system_memory_space_handler() did not release the mapping
used by it previously as soon as the current access was not covered
by it.

In order to improve that, modify acpi_ex_system_memory_space_handler()
to take advantage of the memory mappings reference counting at the OS
level if a suitable interface is provided.

Namely, if ACPI_USE_FAST_PATH_MAPPING is set, the OS is expected to
implement acpi_os_map_memory_fast_path() that will return NULL if
there is no mapping covering the given address range known to it.
If such a mapping is there, however, its reference counter will be
incremented and a pointer representing the requested virtual address
will be returned right away without any additional consequences.

That allows acpi_ex_system_memory_space_handler() to acquire
additional references to all new memory mappings with the help
of acpi_os_map_memory_fast_path() so as to retain them until the
memory opregions associated with them go away.  The function will
still use a new "window" mapping if the current one does not
cover the address range at hand, but it will avoid unmapping the
current one right away by adding it to a list of "known" mappings
associated with the given memory opregion which will be deleted at
the opregion deactivation time.  The mappings in that list can be
used every time a "new window" is needed so as to avoid overhead
related to the mapping and unmapping of memory.
