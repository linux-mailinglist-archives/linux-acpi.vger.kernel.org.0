Right, but that is my use case.

By prior art do you mean code, or an existing binding? In either case,
can you please point me to it? Is this a generic binding used on x86
as well, or just for ARM?

My goal here is to augment the binding.

Yes I can add more detail, if that is all that is needed. But we seem
to still not be aligned on the goal.
