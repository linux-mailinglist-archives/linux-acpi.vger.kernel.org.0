I would say 'Majority of the DT systems' since there are exceptions like Qcom
compute platforms where developers put devicetree in an ACPI based laptop with a
BIOS/DMI (for a reason).

Right. I guess the commit tried to be less invasive so the author decided to
limit it to DMI based systems. I couldn't think of any other reasons.

This patch's main motive is to enable D3hot for bridges that was disabled for no
good reasons, other than the one mentioned above. Maybe adding a bit more about
bridge D3hot handling could be of help, but your comment sounds like you are
questioning why allowing D3hot is OK? But we already enable it for newer DMI
based systems. I think the question should be asked is, why PCI core decided to
not allow D3hot for DT based platforms without any user reported issues.
