The purpose of this patch is not to fix a problem reported by the
kernel test robot, so remove this tag.

I know the robot found a problem with a previous version of this
patch, but we treat that the same as a code review comment.  We
normally don't explicitly credit reviewers unless it was something
major, and then it would go in the commit log, not a "Reported-by"
tag.

It makes sense to credit the kernel test robot for things found in
Linus' tree, but it's a little too aggressive about suggesting the tag
for problems with unmerged changes.

This tag can only be added when Lorenzo explicitly supplies it
himself.  I do not see that on the mailing list, so please remove this
tag as well.  After Lorenzo supplies it, you can include it in future
postings as long as you don't make significant changes to the patch.
