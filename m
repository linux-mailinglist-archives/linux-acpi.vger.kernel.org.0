Yep, it is a design defect of firmware. I will explicitly document
the purpose of this patch in next version.

After this patch, we use explicit call to init GHES rather than initcall.
The GHES message here is just to prove that GHES initialization is
advanced to 3.694557 seconds.

From the log code behavior, the APEI bit refers to OSC_SB_APEI_SUPPORT.
(BIT 4, ACPI v6.4, sec 6.2.11.2,  table Table 6.13 Platform-Wide _OSC
Capabilities DWORD 2. [1])

    /* code in drivers/acpi/apei/ghes.c */
    if (rc == 0 && osc_sb_apei_support_acked)
        pr_info(GHES_PFX "APEI firmware first mode is enabled by APEI bit and WHEA _OSC.\n");

    /* code in drivers/acpi/bus.c */
    osc_sb_apei_support_acked =
        capbuf_ret[OSC_SUPPORT_DWORD] & OSC_SB_APEI_SUPPORT;

Yep, WHEA is an obsolete name. I think apei_osc_setup() is added for compatibility
in commit eccddd32ced0 ("ACPI, APEI, Add APEI bit support in generic _OSC call")'

The ACPI spec Platform-Wide OSPM Capabilities defines
UUID "0811B06E-4A27-44F9-8D60-3CBBC22E7B48" is used in
acpi_bus_osc_support(). The Microsoft WHEA defines
UUID "ed855e0c-6c90-47bf-a62a-26de0fc5ad5c" that is used
in apei_osc_setup(). [2][3]

From the discussion[4], the GHES message is to distinguish between
the two specs.

    To avoid confusion, can we change the message as follow.

    - generic _OSC succeeded, APEI _OSC failed: APEI firmware first mode is
    enabled by APEI bit.
    - generic _OSC failed, APEI _OSC succeeded: APEI firmware first mode is
    enabled by WHEA _OSC.
    - both succeeded: APEI firmware first mode is enabled by APEI bit and
    WHEA _OSC.
    - both failed: Failed to enable APEI firmware first mode!

GHES works in "Firmware First" mode to report platform hardware error
and it depends on APEI interface. (drivers/acpi/apei/ghes.c)

   * Generic Hardware Error Source provides a way to report platform
   * hardware errors (such as that from chipset). It works in so called
   * "Firmware First" mode, that is, hardware errors are reported to
   * firmware firstly, then reported to Linux by firmware.

Based on above, I think the GHES message just means that this booting
kernel supports APEI or WHEA, and GHES report Firmware first errors on
this machine. Is it fine to keep the message?

I tried to move them into acpi_init(), and it works well.
