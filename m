We found this when testing the functions of AER and hotplug. The pcie_aspm=off
is added by the tester who found it affect the function and it makes us think
that it maybe not reasonable to couple these 3 services together.

I'm a bit confused about the 'configurable' here, is it only about PME
and hotplug share the same interrupt? Currently the PME and hotplug
interrupt is allocated by the pcie port driver and PME can get the irq
if the interrupt is allocated successfully.

thanks for the reference. So it indicates that native hotplug depends
on ASPM? But maybe not AER or PME, as commented following above sample
in the spec:

// Always allow native PME, AER (no dependencies)

So the AER should work on pcie_aspm=off, does it make sense?

I agree on this and I think this approach can resolve the condition here.
If os got the ASPM control but user sepcified pcie_aspm=off, I think we
can stop the ASPM link configuring to avoid enable the ASPM function.

ok. thanks for the note.
