Increasing the ACPI_ID_LEN value is fine with me, but the patch
changelog is not entirely accurate.

The ACPI subsystem uses struct acpi_device_id mostly (if not only) for
device ID matching and it is generally used for creating lists of ACPI
device IDs in drivers (and allow/deny lists etc).  The device IDs
extracted from the ACPI tables can be longer than ACPI_ID_LEN.

This means that drivers cannot match device IDs longer than 8
characters (excluding the terminating 0), because the IDs in the lists
used by them for ID matching cannot be longer than this and not
because the ACPI subsystem is limited by that value.
