Slightly OT, but if you do it at init time, you also need to do it
after hibernation because the original ini-time request may not
survive it.

As I said in the previous message, this cannot happen if only one
driver at a time is allowed to request the Aux power on a given Root
Port.

If multiple drivers are allowed to do it, aggregation of requests is necess=
ary.

This is a rather unfortunate and counter-intuitive design decision
IMV.  If the main power is still there, I'd expect the VRAM Self
Refresh to use it instead of the Aux power.
