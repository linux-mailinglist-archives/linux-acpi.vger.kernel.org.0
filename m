Hi,

Thanks for looking at this again.

This is at the moment an ACPI only DSD, and it must follow the MADT 
OEM_ID format for now because we are effectively just overriding that 
field. The rest of the code in this module is just treating it as a 
fixed 6 bytes.

Its not a DT property, and its unclear since its linux only if it 
belongs in previously linked ACPI registry.

I've not tracked down who, if anyone other than the AML compiler is 
guaranteeing a null. The spec says something to the effect "Most other 
string, however,  are of variable-length and are automatically null 
terminated by the compiler". Not sure if that helps any.

Well its just a point to hook in a CFG space quirk, and since that is 
what most of the MCFG quirks are, it seemed reasonable to reuse it 
rather than recreate it.



PS, had some offline convo about reposing with a simple rebase and the 
ACK's applied, will do that if it helps any, but when I checked a couple 
weeks back this applied to 5.15 automatically.
