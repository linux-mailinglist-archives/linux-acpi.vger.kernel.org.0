I don't see this change as adding any more checks.
It's correcting what should have been a more narrow check when that one 
was introduced.

There was no spec backing the 2015 date, it was just "hardware works 
with this and it's needed".

I see this function as stemming from three high level desires that 
intersect.

1) Make hardware not originally designated for the PC ecosystem work.
Macs fall in this camp.  They don't always adhere to the same "firmware 
norms" as UEFI PCs do.  They don't run Microsoft's certifications, and 
thus they don't always work the same.

2) Make hardware compatible to the the ACPI and PCI specs where possible.

3) Make hardware compatible with Windows behavior.

In a strict world <2> would be the only one that was followed and 
everything else would be relegated to quirks or sub-drivers that made 
decisions, but we are where we are.

I'm not saying it's a bad thing that all 3 goals overlap.
If not for the changes that were introduced into this function for Mac 
compatibility I don't think we would Thunderbolt/USB4 where it is today.

The problem is the ACPI spec doesn't say what OSPM should do when 
something isn't power manageable by ACPI.  Can you really argue it should?

Even if we DID manage to get something added to the spec how does that 
help everything already on the marketplace that's broken?

If we can't fix the check to be more narrow the only options I see left:

0) Do nothing.

Document somewhere that if you're on AMD and care about wake from 
keyboard that you need pcie_port_pm=off.  I really don't think this is a 
good idea.  Here's why:

Completely separate from this wake from USB issue I know of another 
issue where some PHX BIOS versions HANG the system during resume because 
of root port being in D3.

It's fixed in newer PHX BIOS versions, but if you end up with an OEM 
system that happened to launch with one of these you're in a very bad 
place.  I haven't mentioned it because I've not seen an OEM system with 
this yet.

If we "do nothing" the only way to solve those will be to grow the DMI 
avoid list if any of these come up.

1) Hardcode all the Intel root ports that need D3 into a quirk list.

I don't know how big this list is, but I assume it's massive and doesn't 
scale unless the constraints stuff works for Intel to opt in the newer
things.

2) Hardcode quirks for all the affected AMD PCI root ports to avoid D3.

It's 4 of them for the 2022-2023 platforms.
It will probably be another 2 more for 2024 ones, and then another 2 
more for 2025 ones.
Maybe by 2025 the affected root port can handle D3 and let USB wake it 
up?  I don't know.

3) Move the quirk somewhere that AMD can maintain specifically for this 
case outside of drivers/pci.

I did prototype it being put into drivers/platform/x86/amd/pmc.c or 
drivers/platform/x86/amd/pmc_quirks.c instead as part of the suspend 
callbacks or LPS0 callbacks.

This works and can scale as that driver at a minimum gets new IDs added 
for new platforms.  However it makes all this logic much more convoluted 
and harder for anyone to follow.
