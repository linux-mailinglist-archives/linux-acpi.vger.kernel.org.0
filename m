That sounds like a possibility.  The spec already defines a
Vendor-Specific Extended Capability (PCIe r5.0, sec 7.9.5) that might
be a candidate.

ACPI has _DSM (ACPI v6.3, sec 9.1.1), which might be a candidate.  I
like this better than a PCI capability because the property you need
to expose is not a PCI property.
