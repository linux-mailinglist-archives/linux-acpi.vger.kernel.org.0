The previous thread had some suggestions, but no real conclusions.
That's probably why we're still arguing about it...

I think this is a reasonable suggestion. However, as Greg pointed out
it's gratuitously different to what USB does for no real reason.

He's suggesting you pull the "authorized" attribute into the driver
core. That's the mechanism USB uses to block drivers binding unless
userspace authorizes them. I don't see any reason why we can't re-use
that sysfs interface for PCI devices since the problem being solved is
fundamentally the same. The main question is what we should do as a
default policy in the kernel. For USB the default comes from the
"authorized_default" module param of usbcore:

So the default policy for USB is to authorize any wired USB device and
we can optionally restrict that to just integrated devices. Sounding
familiar?

The internal / external status is still useful to know so we might
want to make a sysfs attribute for that too. However, I'd like to
point out that internal / external isn't the whole story. As I
mentioned in the last thread if I have a BMC device I *really* don't
want it to be authorized by default even though it's an internal
device. Similarly, if I know all my internal cards support PCIe
Component Authentication then I might choose not to trust any PCI
devices unless they authenticate successfully.

Yep, that's a problem. If we want to provide a useful mechanism to
userspace then the default behaviour of the kernel can't undermine
that mechanism. If that means we need another kernel command line
parameter then I guess we just have to live with it.
