Hi All,

This series of patches addresses a few issues related to the handling of
hibernation in the PCI bus type and the ACPI PM domain and ACPI LPSS driver.

First of all, all of the runtime-suspended PCI devices and devices in the ACPI PM and LPSS
PM domains will be resumed during hibernation (first patch).  This appears to be the
only way to avoid weird corner cases and the benefit from avoiding to resume those
devices during hibernation is questionable.

That change allows the the hibernation callbacks in all of the involved subsystems to be
simplified (patches 2 and 3).

While at it, there is a subtle issue in the LPSS suspend callbacks which is addressed
by patch 4.

Moreover, reusing bus-level suspend callbacks for the "poweroff" transition during
hibernation (which is the case for the ACPI PM domain and LPSS) is incorrect, so patch 5
fixes that.

Finally, there are some leftover items in linux/acpi.h that can be dropped (patch 6).

Thanks,
Rafael
