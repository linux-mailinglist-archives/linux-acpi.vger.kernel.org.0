Hi! Thanks for your reply.
Got you!
And for x86 platform, NMI is not only for hw errors, it does have some other
functions like watchdog, and maybe others i don't know.
when CPU is in heavy workload, the NMI watchdog will be triggered 
repeatily, and it will come to ghes_notify_nmi, the atomic raw_spin_lock
may lock the memory bus which may have little performance inpact to other
coresi i think.
I think you may modify it.

Thanks
Aili Yao
