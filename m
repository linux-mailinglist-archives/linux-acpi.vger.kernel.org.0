Hi Rafael,

For Type C ports, we have Type C connectors at /sys/class/typec in
which we can add generic location information, as you suggested.
However, since Type A ports do not have such connectors, I was curious
what would be a good way to add a generic location, instead of
exposing _PLD directly in the USB-A port's ACPI device.

Now that I think about it again and look through sysfs, I think we can
also add generic location to
/sys/bus/usb/devices/.../<hub_interface>/port<X>, some of which
represents Type A ports. Benson, do you think this could be a good way
for Type A ports? Who would be a good person to get feedback on this?

Heikki, I am also convinced by Rafael's feedback since userspace code
would also be quite ACPI-specific to access _PLD fields from ACPI
device sysfs. Would you agree? Regarding your concerns with DT, we can
look for some ways to have similar location information on systems
with DT. Would it sound okay to you to add generic location in Type C
connectors? If it does, I can start working on it and send patches for
review. If it does not, I would appreciate it if you can share your
thoughts on possible alternative approach.

Thank you very much all for the feedback!
Won
