This slipped by me. The flags are entirely gone now.

I found some other stale comments like references to "mbox_lock" that I'm also
cleaning up.

An unreleased version of this series did just that. Dan suggested the change. My
original preference was your suggestion FWIW, but over time I've come to prefer
this.

We can drop flags now, and we could add more macros to make it a bit better:

CXL_CMD_IN(FOO, 0x10) // we have none in the driver today
CXL_CMD_OUT(IDENTIFY, 0x43)
CXL_CMD_INOUT(GET_LSA, 0x8, ~0)

MUTEX should be gone. KERNEL is still there, and I will move it to later.
