Hi Bjorn, thanks for taking a look.

Yes, PCIe is involved, but mostly only for the CXL.io slow path
(configuration and provisioning via mailbox) when we're talking about
memory expander devices (CXL calls these Type-3). So-called "Type-3"
support is the primary driver of this infrastructure.

You might be thinking of CXL accelerator devices that will look like
plain PCIe devices that happen to participate in the CPU cache
hierarchy (CXL calls these Type-1). There will also be accelerator
devices that want to share coherent memory with the system (CXL calls
these Type-2).

The infrastructure being proposed here is primarily for the memory
expander (Type-3) device case where the PCI sysfs hierarchy is wholly
unsuited for modeling it. A single CXL memory region device may span
multiple endpoints, switches, and host bridges. It poses similar
stress to an OS device model as RAID where there is a driver for the
component contributors to an upper level device / driver that exposes
the RAID Volume (CXL memory region interleave set). The CXL memory
decode space (HDM: Host Managed Device Memory) is independent of the
PCIe MMIO BAR space.

That's where the /sys/bus/cxl hierarchy is needed, to manage the HDM
space across the CXL topology in a way that is foreign to PCIE (HDM
Decoder hierarchy).

Yes, that is the proposal.

The superfluous power/ issue can be cleaned up with
device_set_pm_not_required().

What are the other problems this poses, because in other areas this
ability to subdivide a device's functionality into sub-drivers is a
useful organization principle? So much so that several device writer
teams came together to create the auxiliary-bus for the purpose of
allowing sub-drivers to be carved off for independent functionality
similar to the portdrv organization.

That said, I'm open to CXL switch support *not* building on the
portdrv model, but I'm not yet on the same page with your concern.
