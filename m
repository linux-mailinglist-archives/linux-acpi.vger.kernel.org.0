That was sorta true since the arm64/ACPI/PCI patches landed. The 
underlying reason is the desire for arm platforms to require less 
one-off kernel patching in order to "just work". But, its become 
apparent that there continue to be problems with PCIe IP and Arm 
interconnect integration. So, a firmware interface was standardized 
which solves most of the nonstandard ECAM issues. At that point it was 
decided though that the kernel maintainers would prefer to have the 
quirks visible to the kernel rather than hidden in the firmware, and 
that they would be more open to merging these quirks. The Tegra patch 
you listed above has been merged.
