The PI and UEFI specifications are both maintained by the UEFI forum.

The UEFI specification covers external APIs for firmware
implementations, i.e., the OS visible interface and the public API for
UEFI device drivers that are not tightly integrated with system
firmware (for example, the GPU boot time driver in the ROM of an
add-in card)

The UEFI forum's PI spec describes system firmware internals, and
defines the SEC, PEI DXE and BDS boot phases, among other things.

It is possible to implement UEFI without PI (which is what uboot does,
for instance), but Tianocore/EDK2 is the reference implementation for
both PI and UEFI, and sadly, there is no discernible distinction
between the two (e.g., both PI and UEFI use identifiers with EFI_ type
and enum identifier prefixes)

'platform init' in the context of this discussion is something
completely separate, and has zero bearing on the PI<->UEFI handover in
Tianocore (which is not really a handover to begin with).

There is code in Tianocore which allows it to run as a 'payload',
which means [presumably] that only the DXE and subsequent phases are
launched from a 'platform init' component that describes the platform
using some of the DT bindings that are under discussion here. In this
case, I can see how some of the ACPI descriptions provided by the
'platform init' might be inherited by the 'payload'. However, I don't
see how such a Tianocore payload would make meaningful use of
boot/runtime code/data described in general terms using this proposed
binding, which is why I keep asking for an example scenario.
