We are trying to reach out to Epson to find valid IDs, but will do that
off-list for now.

In the meantime we will propose just the I2C patches, without ACPI.

We have Werner Zeh here, who pushed the coreboot change. In coreboot
nobody objected, maybe they have not been aware of the processes or it
was missed in their review.

Werner i think the coreboot change should be reverted so it does not
enter a release and will become legacy that needs to be supported. Let
us revisit it once we have the proper IDs. If that fails we have to
look into the other options that Andy proposed. There is no point
having the coreboot support without the Linux-user ... 

regards,
Henning
