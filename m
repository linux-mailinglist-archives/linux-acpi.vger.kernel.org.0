Nevertheless, that is the goal.

Please don't widen the discussion as we are having enough trouble as
it is. Let's focus on the memory reservations.

That looks like Tianocore internals rather than a binding, so far as I
can tell. I do need a binding.

OK I'll try that patch again with compatible strings instead of node names[=

OK I'll try again.

[1] I was led down the node-name path by this text in the DT spec
"Following the generic-names recommended practice, node names should
reflect the purpose of the node (ie. =E2=80=9Cframebuffer=E2=80=9D or =E2=
=80=9Cdma-pool=E2=80=9D).
Unit address (@<address>) should be appended to the name if the node
is a static allocation."
