Hmm, I tried to get an Odroid-XU3 up and running, but it seems unable to 
boot my original 6.14-rc3-based branch - even with the IOMMU driver 
disabled, it's consistently dying somewhere near (or just after) init 
with what looks like some catastrophic memory corruption issue - very 
occasionally it's managed to print the first line of various different 
panics.

Before that point though, with the IOMMU driver enabled it does appear 
to show signs of working OK:

[    0.649703] exynos-sysmmu 14650000.sysmmu: hardware version: 3.3
[    0.654220] platform 14450000.mixer: Adding to iommu group 1
...
[    2.680920] exynos-mixer 14450000.mixer: exynos_iommu_attach_device: 
Attached IOMMU with pgtable 0x42924000
...
[    5.196674] exynos-mixer 14450000.mixer: 
exynos_iommu_identity_attach: Restored IOMMU to IDENTITY from pgtable 
0x42924000
[    5.207091] exynos-mixer 14450000.mixer: exynos_iommu_attach_device: 
Attached IOMMU with pgtable 0x42884000


The multi-instance stuff in probe/release does look a bit suspect, 
however - seems like the second instance probe would overwrite the first 
instance's links, and then there would be a double-del() if the device 
were ever actually released again? I may have made that much more likely 
to happen, but I suspect it was already possible with async driver probe...

Thanks,
Robin.
