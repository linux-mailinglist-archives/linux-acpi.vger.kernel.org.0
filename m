Right, the premise of the issue that guest and host should have the
same OSC features is flawed.  The guest is a virtual machine that can
present an entirely different feature set from the host.  A software
hotplug on the guest can occur without any bearing to the slot status
on the host.

If vfio-pci is involved, a cooperative hot-unplug will attempt to
unbind the host driver, which triggers a device request through vfio,
which is ultimately seen as a hotplug eject operation by the guest.
Surprise hotplugs of assigned devices are not supported.  There's not
enough info in the bz to speculate how this VM is wired or what actions
are taken.  Thanks,

Alex
