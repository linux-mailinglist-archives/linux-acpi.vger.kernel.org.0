Correct this "when we assign the 0xdfa00000-0xdfafffff region to
the 00:1c.0 MMIO window, resume fails" is my conclusion too.

> I don't see a theory about what the root cause is.

Correct, because I have no theory, I merely observed that:

1. 0xdfa00000-0xdfa0ffff (note the 0 between the a and ffff)
is reserved in the E820 ranges (this was first seen with
classic BIOS boot, but also reproduces with EFI bootiung)

2. If the kernel assigns PCI resources to it despite it being
reserved the reporter reports resume being broken.

I indeed do not know the exact cause of this.

I definitely consider this another case of _CRS being defective
and it is similar to 1 in that regards, yes.

The 4dc2287c1805 workaround does apply here. The problem is that
my earlier patch which Rafael merged to not honor e820 reservations
on newer BIOS-es broke suspend/resume since that patch disables
the 4dc2287c1805 workaround on this machine.

The comment tries to mention this issue as a second case of
why the 4dc2287c1805 workaround is necessary.

The goal of this part of the comment is to explain why we
cannot just disable the 4dc2287c1805 workaround.

It does not help with case 2 from the comment, since that
case is already effectively fixed by the 4dc2287c1805 workaround.

This patch is a replacement for my earlier fix to disable
the 4dc2287c1805 workaround on newer systems. Since that patch
was causing the regression reported in the Red Hat 2029207
the patch to disable the 4dc2287c1805 workaround on newer systems
has been reverted.

So this is yet another attempt to fix the case where
the PCI subsystem cannot assign resources to some PCI
devices because the entire root bridge window is covered
by an EFI memtable MMIO entry, which gets translated into
an e820_table reserved entry.

What this patch does is identify systems which have the
problem of the entire root bridge window being covered
by an EFI memtable MMIO entry and only disable the
4dc2287c1805 workaround there.

The idea here is to only disable arch_remove_reservations()
taking e820 reservations into account on as narrow a set of
systems as possible.

Keeping it enabled on all other systems, including recent
systems. Since recent systems also benefit from the
4dc2287c1805 workaround as the regression from my patch
to disable it on recent systems has shown us.

I hope this helps understand things better.

Regards,

Hans

>> + *
>> + * 2. The Lenovo X1 carbon gen 2 BIOS has an overlap between an EFI/E820
>> + * reserved range and the ACPI provided PCI bridge window:
>> + *  efi: mem46: [MMIO] range=[0x00000000dfa00000-0x00000000dfa0ffff] (0MB)
>> + *  BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000dceff000-0x00000000dfa0ffff] reserved
>> + *  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0xdfa00000-0xfebfffff window]
>> + * If Linux assigns the overlapping 0xdfa00000-0xdfa0ffff range to a PCI BAR
>> + * then the system fails to resume after a suspend.
>> + *
>> + * Recently (2019) some systems have shown-up with EFI memmap MMIO entries
>> + * covering the entire ACPI provided PCI bridge window. These memmap entries
>> + * get converted into e820_table entries, causing all attempts to assign
>> + * memory to PCI BARs which have not been setup by the BIOS to fail.
>> + * For example see these dmesg snippets from a Lenovo IdeaPad 3 15IIL 81WE:
>> + *  efi: mem63: [MMIO] range=[0x0000000065400000-0x00000000cfffffff] (1708MB)
>> + *  BIOS-e820: [mem 0x000000004bc50000-0x00000000cfffffff] reserved
>> + *  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x65400000-0xbfffffff window]
>> + *  pci 0000:00:15.0: BAR 0: no space for [mem size 0x00001000 64bit]
>> + *  pci 0000:00:15.0: BAR 0: failed to assign [mem size 0x00001000 64bit]
>> + *
>> + * To code below checks if the ACPI provided PCI bridge window is fully
>> + * contained within in EFI memmap MMIO region and in that case disables
>> + * the "exclude E820 reserved addresses" workaround to avoid this issue.
