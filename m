Again, "versioned" identifiers will not work over time as you can never
drop old versions, AND a driver author does not know if the underlying
structures that are outside of the driver have changed or not, nor if
the compiler settings have changed, or anything else that could affect
it like that have changed.

Yes, that is very true, but you can not remove user-visible
functionality, which is what you are saying you are going to do here.

Then there is no such thing as live updates :)

How are you going to define this?  We can not break old users when they
upgrade, and so you are going to have to support this "upgrade path" for
forever.

So every single release?

I will be at LPC, but can't guarantee I can make it to that MC, it all
depends on scheduling.

What does "internally fix" mean exactly here?

Ok, then no need for any GUID at all.  Just update and pray! :)

Just keeping a device "alive" while rebooting into the same exact kernel
image seems odd to me given that this is almost never what people
actually do.  They update their kernel with the weekly stable release to
get the new bugfixes (remember we fix 13 CVEs a day), and away you go.
You are saying that this workload would not actually be supported, so
why do you want live update at all?  Who needs this?
