No, it can't.  An existing trips[] table cannot be replaced with a new
one with different trip indices, because those indices are already in
use.  And if the indices are the same, there's no reason to replace
trips.

The driver can take a lock as well.  Forbidding drivers to use the
zone lock is an artificial limitation without technical merit IMV.

I don't see why this would make any difference.
