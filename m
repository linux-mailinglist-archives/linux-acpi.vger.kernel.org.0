Hi,

Thanks for looking at this.

Sure, on all the above comments.

Yes, I made it up. Someone else commented about the "linux," partially 
because it should be "linux-" to conform with 
https://github.com/UEFI/DSD-Guide. But also in the same context of it 
being linux specific.  I think that guide is where it should end up, 
rather than the devicetree bindings.

I guess we can request addition to the uefi- but that seems like a 
mistake this is really (hopefully?) a Linux specific properly as other 
OS's will simply use the SMC. I think we could request another prefix if 
we come up with a good one and think it belongs in that guide.
