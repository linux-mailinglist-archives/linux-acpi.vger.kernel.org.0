Hi,

This is an update including some fixes and extra patches based on the
continuation of the discussion [1].

The first two patches have not changed.

The difference between this one and patch [3/9] in the v2 is the fixed
definition of dev_pm_may_skip_resume(), renamed to dev_pm_skip_resume() by
one of the next patches.

Patch [4/9] changes the handling of the power.may_skip_resume flag to set it
to 'true' by default and updates the subsystems aware of it to clear it when
they don't want devices to stay in suspend.

These are patches [5/9] and [7-8/9] in the v2 and patch [6/9] renames
dev_pm_smart_suspend_and_suspended() to dev_pm_skip_suspend().

This patch [9/9] now and it has been updated to reflect the new code changes.

The pm-sleep-core branch:

  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm.git \
  pm-sleep-core

contains the v2 now.

Cheers!
