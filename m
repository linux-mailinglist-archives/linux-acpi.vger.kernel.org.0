Bug report is https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16228
First dmesg log https://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=26811
shows:

  BIOS-e820: 00000000bfe4dc00 - 00000000c0000000 (reserved)
  pci_root PNP0A03:00: host bridge window [mem 0xbff00000-0xdfffffff]
  pci 0000:00:1f.2: no compatible bridge window for [mem 0xff970000-0xff9707ff]
  pci 0000:00:1f.2: BAR 5: assigned [mem 0xbff00000-0xbff007ff]
  ahci 0000:00:1f.2: controller reset failed (0xffffffff)
  ahci 0000:00:1f.2: failed to stop engine (-5)

The problem is that _CRS advertises [mem 0xbff00000-0xdfffffff], and
we assigned [mem 0xbff00000-0xbff007ff] to 00:1f.2, but
0xbff00000-0xbfffffff is not usable for PCI devices.  My guess is that
it contains host bridge registers, but all we really know is that it
doesn't work.

I think the _CRS that includes non-usable space is clearly a BIOS
defect.

The fix from 4dc2287c1805 was to avoid that region based on the
0xbfe4dc00-0xc0000000 E820 entry, and the result is in
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=30662:

  BIOS-e820: 00000000bfe4dc00 - 00000000c0000000 (reserved)

  pci_root PNP0A03:00: host bridge window [mem 0xff980000-0xff980fff]

  pci 0000:00:1f.2: BAR 5: assigned [mem 0xff980800-0xff980fff]

The patch below doesn't affect this workaround.

I think this is from https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2029207

If I understand correctly, the log in comment 23 from Ivan
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=1859801) is a
case where resume doesn't work:

  BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000dceff000-0x00000000dfa0ffff] reserved
  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0xdfa00000-0xfebfffff window]
  pci 0000:00:1c.0: BAR 14: assigned [mem 0xdfa00000-0xdfbfffff]

And the log in comment 38, also from Ivan,
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=1861539) is a case
where resume *does* work:

  BIOS-e820: [mem 0x00000000dcf00000-0x00000000dfa0ffff] reserved
  efi: mem46: [MMIO        |RUN|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   |  |  |  |  ] range=[0x00000000dfa00000-0x00000000dfa0ffff] (0MB)
  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0xdfa00000-0xfebfffff window]
  pci 0000:00:1c.0: BAR 14: assigned [mem 0xdfb00000-0xdfcfffff]

_CRS advertises [mem 0xdfa00000-0xfebfffff], but when we assign the
0xdfa00000-0xdfafffff region to the 00:1c.0 MMIO window, resume fails.

I don't see a theory about what the root cause is.  It's possible this
is similar to case 1 above, where _CRS is defective.  But here we're
only assigning the 00:1c.0 MMIO window, and 00:1c.0 is a bridge to
[bus 02], and there are no devices on bus 02.  There should be no
transactions that use that MMIO window, so it's not clear why this
should matter.

If this is a _CRS defect similar to case 1, it's possible there are
host bridge registers in 0xdfa00000-0xdfafffff, and BIOS might use
those during resume, and assigning that area to the 00:1c.0 MMIO
window might interfere with that.  But that's a lot of speculation.

If you have a good Lenovo contact, they might be able to confirm or
deny this.

I'm missing some things here that should be obvious; can you help me
out?

  - Why did the 4dc2287c1805 workaround not apply here?  The E820
    region overlaps the _CRS window just like in case 1, so why did we
    assign 0xdfa00000?

  - How does this patch work around the problem?  This patch checks if
    a host bridge window is completely contained in an EFI MMIO
    region, but I don't see such an EFI region here.

It might be interesting to poke around in the 0xdfa00000-0xdfafffff
range.  For example, if Ivan tried things like this, it's possible
we'd find something we could identify as registers:

  # ./rdwrmem -b 4 -m -s 0xdfa00000 -l 256
  # ./rdwrmem -b 4 -m -s 0xdfa40000 -l 256
  # ./rdwrmem -b 4 -m -s 0xdfa80000 -l 256
  # ./rdwrmem -b 4 -m -s 0xdfac0000 -l 256

Both the above look like fixes to an unrelated asm/pci_x86.h
problem that happened to be exposed by including it in
arch/x86/kernel/resource.c.  Most users of asm/pci_x86.h
include linux/pci.h first, which covers up the problem.

This message suggests that marking the host bridge window as MMIO in
EFI is a defect, or at least something unusual and worthy of being
flagged.  But I think it's perfectly legal.

UEFI v2.8, sec 7.2, says EfiMemoryMappedIO means:

  Used by system firmware to request that a memory-mapped IO region be
  mapped by the OS to a virtual address so it can be accessed by EFI
  runtime services.
