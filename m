Can you please clarify that.

for example, the pci has this sysfs control api:

"/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:04:00.0/driver_override" which takes the
*driver name* as data to override what driver is allowed to bind to
this device.
Does this driver_override consider it as using the driver name as part
of the abi? If not, why?

What live update wants is to make that driver_override persistent over
kexec. It does not introduce the "driver_override" API. That is
pre-existing conditions. The PCI liveupdate just wants to use it.

I want to get some basic understanding before adventure into the more
complex solutions.

The GUID is more complex than a driver name. I am fine with not using
GUID if you are so strongly opposed to it.

You are saying don't do A(driver name) and B(GUID). I am waiting for
the part where you say "please do C instead".

Do you have any other suggestion how to prevent the live update PCI
device bind to a different driver after kexec? I am happy to work on
the direction you point out and turn that into a patch for the
discussion purpose.

Thanks
