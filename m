Yes, we would need a new DT binding.

Do you mean a flag exposed via ACPI?  If you do FF-A based discovery you
don't even need that.  Everything could be determined via an FF-A
interface.

There is a lot of history, but I think it was simply that ACPI
advertisement of an FF-A based TPM seemed like the approach
with the least friction. And Linux is not the only target OS.

I don't think we are locked into ACPI (or DT) only discovery.
It's possible that with a modest delta on top of this patch series
that the tpm_crb driver could also probe based on FF-A.

The CRB over FF-A spec (DEN0138) could be extended in a backwards
compatible way to expose additional info like the base address of the
CRB.

Thanks,
Stuart
