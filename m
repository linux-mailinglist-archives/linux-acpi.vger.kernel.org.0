Is that even a valid case though? The principal thing we want to 
accommodate here is when device B *is* the one accessing memory, either 
because it is a bridge with device A sat behind it, or because device A 
is actually just some logical function or subset of physical device B.

If the topology is such that device A is a completely independent device 
with its own path to memory such that it could have different 
properties, I would expect that it *should* be described in DSDT, and I 
can't easily think of a good reason why it wouldn't be. I'm also 
struggling to imagine how it might even have an ID that had to be 
interpreted in the context of device B if it wasn't one of the cases 
above :/

I don't doubt that people could - or maybe even have - come up with crap 
DSDT bindings that don't represent the hardware sufficiently accurately, 
but I'm not sure that should be IORT's problem...
