The issue occurs randomly after a few days of system uptime,
post-boot, during runtime.
The same PCIe card is currently working fine on another machine
running Ubuntu 16.04 with kernel 4.4.0-66-generic. However, the
affected machine is running Ubuntu 20.04 with a newly built latest
kernel. Full testing on the older kernel is still on hold, as we are
currently focusing on recent kernels.
Apart from kernel differences, the BIOS versions are also different on
these systems.
Given that the issue happens at runtime and not during initialization,
could BIOS influence this behavior after boot?

BAR Register Differences & Configuration Source:
------------------------------------------------------------------
The BASE_ADDRESS_0 register differs between the two machines:
Ubuntu 20.04 (buggy system): 0xb0400000
Ubuntu 16.04 (working system): 0xd0400000

I would like to understand who determines this value:
Is it set by BIOS, firmware, or the Linux kernel PCI driver?
Could you provide a reference to the source code where the BAR
registers are assigned and mapped?

Earlier, CONFIG_PCI_DEBUG was not set. I have now enabled it and
started the kernel build. Are there any other important CONFIG debug
options that need to be enabled for debugging this?
