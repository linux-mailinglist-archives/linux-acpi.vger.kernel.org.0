+The ``DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND`` Driver Flag
+------------------------------------------
+
 Some bus types and PM domains have a policy to resume all devices from runtime
 suspend upfront in their ``->suspend`` callbacks, but that may not be really
 necessary if the driver of the device can cope with runtime-suspended devices.
 The driver can indicate that by setting ``DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND`` in
-:c:member:`power.driver_flags` at the probe time, by passing it to the
-:c:func:`dev_pm_set_driver_flags` helper.  That also may cause middle-layer code
+:c:member:`power.driver_flags` at the probe time with the help of the
+:c:func:`dev_pm_set_driver_flags` helper routine.
+
+However, setting that flag also causes the PM core and middle-layer code
 (bus types, PM domains etc.) to skip the ``->suspend_late`` and
 ``->suspend_noirq`` callbacks provided by the driver if the device remains in
-runtime suspend at the beginning of the ``suspend_late`` phase of system-wide
-suspend (or in the ``poweroff_late`` phase of hibernation), when runtime PM
-has been disabled for it, under the assumption that its state should not change
-after that point until the system-wide transition is over (the PM core itself
-does that for devices whose "noirq", "late" and "early" system-wide PM callbacks
-are executed directly by it).  If that happens, the driver's system-wide resume
-callbacks, if present, may still be invoked during the subsequent system-wide
-resume transition and the device's runtime power management status may be set
-to "active" before enabling runtime PM for it, so the driver must be prepared to
-cope with the invocation of its system-wide resume callbacks back-to-back with
-its ``->runtime_suspend`` one (without the intervening ``->runtime_resume`` and
-so on) and the final state of the device must reflect the "active" runtime PM
-status in that case.

+
+In addition, with ``DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND`` set, the driver's ``->thaw_late``

+
+
+The ``DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME`` Driver Flag
+--------------------------------------------
 
 During system-wide resume from a sleep state it's easiest to put devices into
 the full-power state, as explained in :file:`Documentation/power/runtime_pm.rst`.
 [Refer to that document for more information regarding this particular issue as
 well as for information on the device runtime power management framework in
-general.]

-transitions to the working state, especially if those devices had been in
+general.]  However, it often is desirable to leave devices in suspend after
+system transitions to the working state, especially if those devices had been in
 runtime suspend before the preceding system-wide suspend (or analogous)
-transition.  Device drivers can use the ``DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME`` flag to
-indicate to the PM core (and middle-layer code) that they prefer the specific
-devices handled by them to be left suspended and they have no problems with
-skipping their system-wide resume callbacks for this reason.  Whether or not the
-devices will actually be left in suspend may depend on their state before the
-given system suspend-resume cycle and on the type of the system transition under
-way.  In particular, devices are not left suspended if that transition is a
-restore from hibernation, as device states are not guaranteed to be reflected
-by the information stored in the hibernation image in that case.
-
-The middle-layer code involved in the handling of the device is expected to
-indicate to the PM core if the device may be left in suspend by setting its
-:c:member:`power.may_skip_resume` status bit which is checked by the PM core
-during the "noirq" phase of the preceding system-wide suspend (or analogous)
-transition.  The middle layer is then responsible for handling the device as
-appropriate in its "noirq" resume callback, which is executed regardless of
-whether or not the device is left suspended, but the other resume callbacks
-(except for ``->complete``) will be skipped automatically by the PM core if the
-device really can be left in suspend.
-
-For devices whose "noirq", "late" and "early" driver callbacks are invoked
-directly by the PM core, all of the system-wide resume callbacks are skipped if
-``DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME`` is set and the device is in runtime suspend during
-the ``suspend_noirq`` (or analogous) phase or the transition under way is a
-proper system suspend (rather than anything related to hibernation) and the
-device's wakeup settings are suitable for runtime PM (that is, it cannot

-sleep).
+transition.
+
+To that end, device drivers can use the ``DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME`` flag to
+indicate to the PM core and middle-layer code that they allow their "noirq" and
+"early" resume callbacks to be skipped if the device can be left in suspend
+after system-wide PM transitions to the working state.  Whether or not that is
+the case generally depends on the state of the device before the given system
+suspend-resume cycle and on the type of the system transition under way.
+In particular, the "restore" and "thaw" transitions related to hibernation are
+not affected by ``DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME`` at all.  [All devices are always
+resumed during the "restore" transition and whether or not any driver callbacks
+are skipped during the "freeze" transition depends whether or not the
+``DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND`` flag is set (see `above <smart_suspend_flag_>`_).]
+
+The ``DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME`` flag is taken into account in combination with
+the :c:member:`power.may_skip_resume` status bit set by the PM core during the
+"suspend" phase of suspend-type transitions.  If the driver or the middle layer
+has a reason to prevent the driver's "noirq" and "early" resume callbacks from
+being skipped during the subsequent resume transition of the system, it should
+clear :c:member:`power.may_skip_resume` in its ``->suspend``, ``->suspend_late``
+or ``->suspend_noirq`` callback.  [Note that the drivers setting
+``DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND`` need to clear :c:member:`power.may_skip_resume` in
+their ``->suspend`` callback in case the other two are skipped.]
+
+Setting the :c:member:`power.may_skip_resume` status bit along with the
+``DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME`` flag is necessary, but generally not sufficient,
+for the driver's "noirq" and "early" resume callbacks to be skipped.  Whether or
+not they should be skipped can be determined by evaluating the
+:c:func:`dev_pm_skip_resume` helper function.
+
+If that function returns ``true``, the driver's "noirq" and "early" resume
+callbacks should be skipped and the device's runtime PM status will be set to
+"suspended" by the PM core.  Otherwise, if the device was runtime-suspended
+during the preceding system-wide suspend transition and
+``DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND`` is set for it, its runtime PM status will be set to
+"active" by the PM core.  [Hence, the drivers that do not set
+``DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND`` should not expect the runtime PM status of their
+devices to be changed from "suspended" to "active" by the PM core during
+system-wide resume-type transitions.]
+
+If the ``DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME`` flag is not set for a device, but
+``DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND`` is set and the driver's "late" and "noirq" suspend
+callbacks are skipped, its system-wide "noirq" and "early" resume callbacks, if
+present, are invoked as usual and the device's runtime PM status is set to
+"active" by the PM core before enabling runtime PM for it.  In that case, the
+driver must be prepared to cope with the invocation of its system-wide resume
+callbacks back-to-back with its ``->runtime_suspend`` one (without the
+intervening ``->runtime_resume`` and system-wide suspend callbacks) and the
+final state of the device must reflect the "active" runtime PM status in that
+case.  [Note that this is not a problem at all if the driver's
+``->suspend_late`` callback pointer points to the same function as its
+``->runtime_suspend`` one and its ``->resume_early`` callback pointer points to
+the same function as the ``->runtime_resume`` one, while none of the other
+system-wide suspend-resume callbacks of the driver are present, for example.]
+
+Likewise, if ``DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME`` is set for a device, its driver's
+system-wide "noirq" and "early" resume callbacks may be skipped while its "late"
+and "noirq" suspend callbacks may have been executed (in principle, regardless
+of whether or not ``DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND`` is set).  In that case, the driver
+needs to be able to cope with the invocation of its ``->runtime_resume``
+callback back-to-back with its "late" and "noirq" suspend ones.  [For instance,
+that is not a concern if the driver sets both ``DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND`` and
+``DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME`` and uses the same pair of suspend/resume callback
+functions for runtime PM and system-wide suspend/resume.]
