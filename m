Hi Wathsala,

Superficially this feels like another potential interface that could be wrapped
up under appropriate fwctl. Jason, what do you think?

Mind you I'm not personally convinced that an interface that focuses on
exposing _DSM calls to userspace makes sense as opposed to subsystem specific
stuff.

Maybe consider associating the actual interface with the individual PCI functions
(which provides the first chunk of the message directly).

Also, _DSM is just one form of firmware interface used for PCI supporting
system. Tying the userspace interface to that feels unwise.  I can certainly
foresee a PSCI/SCMI or similar interface for this on ARM platforms
wrapped up in _DSM where ACPI is present but directly accessed when DT
is in use.

I'd also request that you break out what goes in ARG0,1,2 as that is all
stuff that the kernel is aware of and not all reviewers have access to the
ECN (I do though).  In particular the fact there are ACPI UIDs may
need a more generic solution.

Jonathan
