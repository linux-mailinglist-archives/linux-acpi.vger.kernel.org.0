True, but in the ECDT case the EC opregion should work anywhere
according to the spec, so I believe it is consistent with the spec.

You are right, but this can be fixed by keeping track of the handle
used when registering the handler, e.g. something like this:

Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: EC: Fix EC address space handler unregistration

When an ECDT table is present the EC address space handler gets registered
on the root node. So to unregister it properly the unregister call also
must be done on the root node.

Store the ACPI handle used for the acpi_install_address_space_handler()
call and use te same handle for the acpi_remove_address_space_handler()
call.

This fixes ec_remove_handlers() without requiring (IMHO) risky changes
where we call _REG() multiple times.

Also note that ec_remove_handlers() is only ever called from
acpi_ec_driver.remove which in practice never runs since the EC never
gets hot unplugged (arguably the entire remove code could be removed).

I'm pretty worried that calling _REG(EC, 0) will cause problems
the _REG handlers run pretty early on and various BIOS/ACPI table
authors seem to (ab)use this to do some sort of early setup
of some things in _REG, That is pretty much how this whole thread
has started. Given all the weirdness some ACPI tables do in their
_REG handling running _REG 3 times:

1. _REG(EC, 1)
2. _REG(EC, 0)
3. _REG(EC, 1)

really seems like a bad idea to me. I have the feeling that this is
asking for trouble.

> Second, the spec is kind of suggesting doing it (cf. the "These

That is boilerplate documentation copy and pasted from all the
other address space handlers the spec defines. I'm not sure if
Windows ever actually calls _REG(EmbeddedControl, 0) and I would
not be surprised if Windows does not do this.

As mentioned before (IIRC) I would be more then happy to respin both
the ACPICA as well as the Linux ACPI bits to introduce / use 2 new
functions for this, lets say:

1. acpi_install_address_space_handler_no__reg()
2. acpi_run_address_space_handler__reg()

?

Hans
