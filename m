Thanks for having a look - there was the feeling that this was ready
for merging based on the review comments from the previous series sent
by James.

However, when I sent this series, I did notice that some mailing lists
were missing, so I guess that's could be why you haven't commented
before, and we find out now that there are major concerns.

My interest in it is because my employer wants to be able to hotplug
CPUs in a virtual machine, and this saga with aarch64 has been running
for years with different approaches ending up dead in the water. I
hope your concerns do not result in this approach being entirely
scrapped, and there can be some solution found.

I think James Morse will need to be involved in addressing your
concerns since he has the detailed background about the history of
this series. However, James seemed to fall totally silent after the
last posting back in September, so whether that is possible is
currently unknown.
