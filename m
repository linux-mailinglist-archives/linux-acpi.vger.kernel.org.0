Bear in mind that one or both sides of this interface may be UEFI.
There is no boot-services link between the two parts that I have
outlined.

OK thanks.

The point is that Platform Init and the payload need to agree about
where certain things are in memory. It is true that this is coming
from an EFI context, but that is just an example. Platform Init
doesn't necessarily know whether its payload is EFI, but may set this
up for use by the payload, just in case.
