So the counter argument here is that using the zone lock directly in
the driver is the most straightforward way of addressing the use case
at hand, which is the need to update trip points in a non-racy way.
Everything else is more complex and the reasons for adding the extra
complexity can be questioned.

Self-containment is nice, but in some cases it is just not worth
enforcing it all the way through at the cost of increased code
complexity.

Anyway, I'm going to post a new version of this patch series later
today which uses a somewhat different approach. It is a bit more
complex, but maybe this is fine.
