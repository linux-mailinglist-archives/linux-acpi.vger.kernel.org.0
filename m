Right, the UEFI specs only describe the GHES/ACPI path. There isn’t
a spec-defined transport for firmware-first CPER delivery outside ACPI/GHES,
which is why patch 9/12 describes a Linux-side DT contract
for exposing the CPER status buffer and notification path.
If there’s a better place to document or name that DT transport, I’d appreciate pointers.

You’re right that per UEFI/ACPI, GHES is the only standardised delivery path.
My goal isn’t to redefine that; it’s to avoid duplicating the CPER parsing/logging
code for non-ACPI platforms. I’m happy to restructure the helpers however you
think best so we keep the existing ACPI/APEI maintainer model intact.

That scenario is a firmware-first platform where firmware still produces a UEFI
CPER Generic Error Status block but signals Linux via the DT-described transport.
Once the buffer is available, the provider feeds it into the same estatus decoding path as GHES.
