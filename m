TBH I'm not exactly buying the "tested revision ID" concept because
what does it really mean?

If a given _DSM interface has been tested on one platform, does it
necessarily mean that it will work on all of the other platforms
implementing it?

This is a real possibility, however, because there's nothing to
prevent this kind of spec interpretation.

I didn't mean this, though.

Say the kernel wants to use a function that is only defined at rev 5.
It will invoke function 0 at rev 5 to see if this function is
available, but then it may as well see if the other functions it wants
to use are available at rev 5 because it will get this information
from the same _DSM call.  If the platform firmware responds that they
all are implemented, why won't the kernel use them all at rev 5?

Sure.  That's why function 0 should always be used.

You seem to be questioning the interface versioning at large by saying
that there is no real guarantee of backwards compatibility between
consecutive interface revisions on the same platform.

Presumably, though, the interface is adhering to some specification
which defines the behavior of the functions (and the set of available
functions in the first place) for all of the valid revisions of it.
The OS and the platform firmware both follow the same spec and so they
should be mutually compatible.  If this particular spec defines rev 5
to be an exact superset of rev 4, there is no reason to expect
anything else.
