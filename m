Just to check I've understood corectly, you mean multiple instances of same
protocol across different DOE mailboxes on a given device?

At DOE ECN level I don't think it is actually defined if they can
interact or not.  I've trawled though the released protocols that I know of
to see if there is a consensus but not finding much information.

I would argue however that there would be no reason to have the OS make
use of more than one DOE mailbox for the same protocol. Bit fiddly to
handle, but doesn't seem impossible to only register a protocol with first
DOE that supports it.

CMA does talk about use of multiple methods to communicate with the device
and the need for results consistency. However that is referring to out of
band vs DOE rather than multiple DOEs.  Plus it isn't making statements
about protocol coordination just responses to particular queries.

Things might get crazy if you tried to do IDE setup from two different DOE
mailboxes. The IDE ECN refers to "the specific instance of DOE used for..."
implying I think that there might be multiple but software should only
use one of them?

My other gut feeling is that only some of the DOE mailboxes are ever going
to be in the control of Linux. IDE calls out models where firmware or a TEE is
responsible for it for example. I'm not sure how that is going to be communicated
to the OS (can guess of course)

Sub drivers are a plausible model that I'll think about some more - but
for now it feels like too early to go that way..

Gah. One day I'll remember to spell check. Sorry about that.

I'm not sure it's possible to do so without breaking the abstraction of
DOE request / response into a bunch of messy sub steps.  Perhaps there is
a clean way of doing it but I can't immediately think of it.

If a protocol comes along that varies the timeout we can just add
a parameter to say what it is on a call by call basis.

Agreed.  Though might be worth some debug checks.

Speaking from experience it's easy to spend half a day wondering why your
interrupts aren't turning up (I was blaming QEMU) because bus mastering
wasn't enabled.

Nice!  Looking at CMA / IDE emulation was on my todo list and that looks like
it might make that job a lot easier.

No, unless I'm missing something, that is one command per DOE mailbox at a time.
The completion is part of the pcie_doe structure, not the pci_dev.
That represents a single DOE mailbox.

There can be multiple commands in flight to multiple DOE mailboxes. Not clear
that there ever will be in real use cases however.

This comes up later wrt to async operation.  The mailbox only
supports one request / response cycle at a time, they cannot be overlapped.

No need for the complexity with one request / response in flight per
mailbox at a time and each mailbox having separate state maintenance.

Good question.  I think the answer to that is dead device, reboot the machine
or at least the device if you can do a hard enough slot reset.

The specification goes with...
"It is strongly recommend that implementations ensure that the functionality
of the DOE Abort bit is resilient, including that DOE Abort functionality is
maintained even in cases where device firmware is malfunctioning"

So cross our fingers everyone obeys that strong recommendation or try to
work out what to do?

I'm a bit doubtful on naming of register() but will go with that for v2.

It's not registering with anything so that feels a bit wrong as a description
for part 2 of setup.  Can leave that bike shedding for now though.

Yes, but the descriptive header is very brea.

I'll see what I can come up with for v2.
Likely to look something like

int pcie_doe_exchange(struct pci_doe *doe, u16 vid, u8 type,
		      u32 *request_pl, size_t request_pl_sz,
		      u32 *response_pl, size_t response_pl_sz)

and return received length or negative on error.

The disadvantage is that at least some of the specs just have the
header as their first few DW.  So there isn't a clear distinction
between header and payload. May lead to people getting offsets wrong
in a way they wouldn't do if driver was responsible for building the
whole message.

Agreed. It is crazy. At very least we need a means of saying
keep your hands off this DOE to the OS.

We can't do it on a per protocol basis, which was what I was previously
thinking, because we can't call the discovery protocol to see what
a given DOE is for.

Given it's single element in flight I don't think there is any benefit
to enabling async.  The lock has to be held throughout anyway.
It is always possible a particular caller wants to overlap this
transaction with some other actions, but I'd rather put the burden
on that clever caller which can spin this out to a thread of one type
or another.

We can revisit and split this in half if we have a user who benefits
from the complexity.

oops. That's exiting with mutex held. Fixed in v2.

Well the field names are going to end up as dw0 dw1 etc as there isn't a lot more
meaningful to call them.  We also want to keep them as u32 values throughout to
avoid fiddly packing manipulation on different endian machines.

This becomes rather simpler when it's just the payload due to changes in the
interface in v2.

I'm not sure I follow.

Any driver will fall into one of the following categories:
a) Already knows what protocols are available on a
   given DOE instance perhaps because that's a characteristic of the hardware
   supported, in which case it has no reason to check (unless driver writer
   is paranoid)
b) It has no way to know (e.g. class driver), then it makes sense to query
   the DOE instance to find out what protocols are available.

Absolutely we could cache them, but it wouldn't change the interface
presented to the driver. I think doing so at this stage is
premature optimization.

We could present this at a different level and wrap it up as a
find_doe that will return a DOE instance that supports the desired
protocol, but then that puts the burden of reference counting etc
for the different DOE instances on the core - the one thing I think
we want to avoid.

So far we have no evidence any device will actually need that.

Of the existing protocols, only a few are allowed to coexist with
each other and in well defined sets (CMA and IDE for example).

An alternative model we could look at (which is much more complex)
is to have something like the following: 

struct pcie_doe_set - Central location which is responsible for
all DOE mailboxes on a PCI device.

At init that scans all DOE mailboxes and builds a look up table
from [vid, protocol] to [struct pcie_doe]
Note this is 1 to 1, so if a protocol is supported on multiple
mailboxes we use the first one.

pcie_doe_exchange(struct pcie_doe_set, u16 vid, u8 protocol...)
Looks up the relevant DOE instance and does exchange on that.

So far I'm not convinced we should engage in this complexity.
Nothing stops us adding it if and when it becomes apparent we
actually need it.

An intermediate point would be to add basic list and reference
counting infrastructure so that a driver can call

struct pcie_doe *pcie_doe_get(struct pci_dev, u16 vid, u8 protocol)
void pci_doe_put(struct pci_doe *doe);

That means at least a list_head and possibly a lock being added
to pci_dev. Not sure how Bjorn will feel about that.

I might see how bad this looks for v2.

This went away in v2 as we now store the irq to allow it to be removed
in _unregister.

I did change to poll as a parameter to relevant functions

I'll work up a v2 with the above changes and have a mess with list based
handling and reference counting for the DOE instances.
