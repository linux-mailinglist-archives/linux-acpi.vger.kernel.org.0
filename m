My point was that when ECAM is implemented correctly, a CPU does a
single MMIO load to do a PCI config read and a single MMIO store to do
a PCI config write.  In that case there no need for any locking, so
there's no need for APEI to reserve those resources.

This is what d91525eb8ee6 ("ACPI, EINJ: Enhance error injection
tolerance level") does.  That code change makes sense, but the commit
log does not -- it has nothing to do with trusting the ACPI/APEI code;
it's just that no matter what the EINJ actions do with the MCFG
regions, they cannot interfere with other drivers.

This was an example of a case where EINJ mutual exclusion *would* be
required.  I do not expect EINJ actions to use the 0xCF8/0xCFC
registers because there is no mechanism to coordinate that with the OS
use of the same registers.

These currently depend on the pci_lock.  See PCI_OP_READ() in
drivers/pci/access.c.

EINJ actions cannot acquire the pci_lock, so EINJ actions cannot
safely use ECAM space on those platforms.

I think apei_resources_request() should continue to reserve MCFG areas
on tegra194 and xgene, but it does not need to reserve them on other
ARM64 platforms.
