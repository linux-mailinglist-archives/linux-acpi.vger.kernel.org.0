There might have been some misunderstanding. AEST interface can be 
SR(processor) or MMIO(GIC, SMMU, Memory), All these two types of nodes 
have ERR<n>STATUS register, and AEST driver need to operate these filed 
both in SR and MMIO register.

OK, i will add an ISB at the end of aest_proc to ensure all writes has 
taken effect.

I get it. Relaxed accesses are still guaranteed to be ordered when 
operating MMIO address. I will use readq/writeq_relaxed in next version.

It depends on HW designer especially for DDRC, and i think **SHARED** is 
more compatible. But in fact, I'm not sure if driver should assume that 
all RAS interruptions are no shared. If AEST driver set IRQ no shared, 
does it need to loop through all AEST node first to ensure no node 
sharing interrupt?
