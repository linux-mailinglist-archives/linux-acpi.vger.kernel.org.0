PCI devices *can* be described in the DSDT.  IIUC these particular
devices are hardwired (not plug-in cards), so platform firmware can
know about them and could describe them in the DSDT.

You can look for a _DSM wherever it is convenient for you.  It could
be in an AMBA shim layer.

I don't quite understand what this means, but as I mentioned before, a
quirk for a *limited* number of devices is OK, as long as there is a
plan that removes the need for a quirk for future devices.

E.g., if the next platform version ships with a DTB or firmware with a
_DSM or other mechanism that enables the kernel to discover this
information without a kernel change, it's fine to use a quirk to cover
the early platform.

The principles are:

  - I don't want to have to update a quirk for every new Device ID
    that needs this.

  - I don't really want to have to manage non-PCI information in the
    struct pci_dev.  If this is AMBA- or IOMMU-related, it should be
    stored in a structure related to AMBA or the IOMMU.
