Yeah, you're right. While it's a corner case, it's still important to
get it fixed because it risks eroding people's good will for future work.
What you (and Ard) bring up is just as important a roadblock as any of
the other (many *sob*) roadblocks that have been overcome for its
adoption.

Well, I'm for #1, though perhaps with a more narrow view: some semantics
are just weird/surprising. ;) Until I first encountered this warning a
few years ago when working on GCC_PLUGIN_STRUCTLEAK_BYREF_ALL, I didn't
even know putting declarations there was valid C. ;)

Whack-a-mole is part of the work to make these kinds of treewide
changes, but the hope is to find as much of it ahead of time as
possible. And, no, I have no interest in security theater. (Not
everything has equal levels of effectiveness, of course, but I don't
think that's what you're saying.)

Sure. I think I am trying to take a pragmatic approach here, which is
that gaining auto-var-init is a big deal (killing entire classes of
vulnerabilities), but it comes with an annoying compiler bug (that we do
get a warning about) for an uncommon code pattern that is easy to fix.
So rather than delaying the defense until the sharp edge on the compiler
gets fixed, I'd like to get the rest rolling while the edge is filed.
