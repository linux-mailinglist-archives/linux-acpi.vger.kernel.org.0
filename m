Well, I think Bjorn is aware of them, but was actually hoping that those broken controllers would go away at some point ;-)
And just to make this clear: I would categorise this issue as an integration bug, which just can't be fixed in hardware or firmware easily. It was never meant to be this way. So I am not sure we should promote generic solutions here.

Interesting, we might evaluate this, but mostly out of curiosity or for debugging. I don't think it's really a better option.
If there is a safe way of making this work in the majority of cases, that should be the way to go. Setting PSTATE.A sounds quite wacky to me.

Thanks,
Andre.
