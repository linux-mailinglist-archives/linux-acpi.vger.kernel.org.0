On x86 Xen does know how to map a GSI into an IO-APIC pin, in order
configure the RTE as requested.

I wouldn't say it's strictly associated with PCI.  A GSI is a way for
ACPI to have a single space that unifies all possible IO-APICs pins in
the system in a flat way.  A GSI is useful in itself because there's
a single GSI space for the whole host.

That's all fine, maybe there's a better path or way to expose this ACPI
information.  Maybe introduce a per-device acpi directory and expose
it there?  Or rename the entry to acpi_gsi?

Thanks, Roger.
