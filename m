Yes, "platform" refers to the BIOS/ACPI subsystem.

Yes, I think a Bus Check notification is just a request for the OS to
re-enumerate starting at the point in the device tree where it is
notified.  It's possible that no add or remove has occurred.  ACPI
r6.5, sec 5.6.6, includes the example of hardware that can't detect
device changes during a system sleep state, so it issues a Bus Check
on wake.

If you could add more debug in hotplug_event() and the things it
calls, we might get more clues about what's happening.

Looks like the device isn't responding at all here.  Could happen if
the device is reset or powered down.

What is this device?  What driver is bound to it?  I don't see
anything in dmesg that identifies a driver.

No, it won't explain that.  But if there was no add/remove event,
re-enumeration should be harmless.  The objective of instrumentation
would be to figure out why it isn't harmless in this case.

You're seeing the problem on v5.4 (Nov 2019), which is much newer than
v4.4 (Jan 2016).  But v5.4 is still really too old to spend a lot of
time on unless the problem still happens on a current kernel.
