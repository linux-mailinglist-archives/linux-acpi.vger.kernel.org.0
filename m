Yes, I do.

I think that it would just be confusing because both the OS and the
firmware would now have to remember which function is defined at which
revision.

Also the industry practice in this respect has been different so far, AFAIC=
S.

And PCI FW r3.3 wants the OS to use the same rev for all functions
which doesn't leave too much room for interpretation.

Well, if you know that the function is supposed to work the same in
the new rev, it only is a matter of changing the rev passed to
acpi_evaluate_dsm*().

So say you've only changed the rev passed to acpi_evaluate_dsm*() as
per the above.  The only reason why it may not work is when there is a
bug in the firmware.

Now, suppose that you don't change anything and stick to rev X-1, but
there is a new version of the firmware that contains a bug in the
given _DSM implementation.  Same thing.

I get the "only the tested code is trustable" argument, but its
applicability here is naturally limited.

Unfortunately, as far as OS-firmware interfaces are concerned, you
need to trust the other end to do the right thing because you cannot
test all of the possible combinations.

I'm not talking about the definition of the interface, but about
dependencies at the implementation level.

Given the PCI FW r3.3 provisions, firmware may assume that the OS will
use the same rev for all functions and it may depend on that.
