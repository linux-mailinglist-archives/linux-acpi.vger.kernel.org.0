Except that as per what you said just in the earlier paragraph ACPI can
tell us otherwise.

Well, such defaulting is an option, but in case it's wrong we might
end up with hard to diagnose issues. Personally I'd prefer if we
didn't take shortcuts here, i.e. if we followed what Dom0 is able
to read from ACPI.
