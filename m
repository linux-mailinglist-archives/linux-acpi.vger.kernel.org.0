Looks like I was correct in my assumption:
ACPI descriptor doesn't distinguish between PCI devices vs bridges.
PCI code enumerates host-bridge first:

 acpiphp_enumerate_slots 
 acpi_pci_add_bus+0x55/0xf0
 pci_register_host_bridge+0x230/0x510
 pci_create_root_bus+0x86/0xb0
 acpi_pci_root_create+0x182/0x2e0

that creates acpi context for direct children, after that
later within acpi_pci_root_create(), pci_scan_child_bus()
is called:

 acpiphp_enumerate_slots+0x1f/0x2b0
 acpi_pci_add_bus+0x55/0xf0
 pci_add_new_bus+0x25c/0x4b0
 pci_scan_bridge_extend+0x655/0x6a0
 pci_scan_child_bus_extend+0xc7/0x290
 acpi_pci_root_create+0x262/0x2e0

which does brute force scan for present devices and if a device is a bridge
it initializes new bus, slot[s] (incl. acpi context with bridge) ... 

While for non existing root-port, acpi context created by the 1st
acpiphp_enumerate_slots() called from host-bridge is only abstract
acpi device handle (kernel doesn't have sufficient data to do anything with it).

So it effectively degrades to hotplug on host-bridge, and enable_slot(...,false)
would try to bring up all new devices in slot/bus.

Where it gets confusing is that DSDT says that native
PCIe hotplug should be used and dmesg confirms that.
But commit 84c8b58ed3add indicates that both hotplug
methods could be used at the same time sometimes.
I'm not sure how that is supposed to work.
