Took most of this as is with some minor rewording.

However, as opposed to device_link_add(), I don't want the caller
holding any reference to the allocated link. So I don't want to return
any pointer to them.

I guess with the function comment explicitly stating "no ref
counting", this is kind of redundant. I can remove this.

No, fwnode links can have cycles. At this state, we can't tell which
ones are invali.d When we create device links out of this, we have
more info at that point and we make sure not to add any device links
that can cause cycles. There are a bunch of corner cases where we
can't tell which one is the invalid fwnode link in the links that make
up the cycle and in those cases, we have to make the device links as
SYNC_STATE_ONLY device links. Long story short, cycles are allowed.

I'd like to leave this as is for now if that's okay.

It's not really a problem as there's nothing that can happen in
between these two calls that can cause a problem but won't be a
problem if it happens after these two calls. I was trying to avoid
repeating the purge supplier/consumer code here again. Can we leave
this as is for now?

I need a fwnode_links_purge_suppliers() (as in, not purging consumer
links) though. I used it later in the series. So instead of repeating
that code for fwnode_links_purge(), I created
fwnode_links_purge_consumers() and called both functions from here.
Can we leave this as is?
