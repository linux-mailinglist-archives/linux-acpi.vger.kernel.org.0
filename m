Because the bind/unbind/override was created as a debug facility for
doing kernel development and then people have turned it into a "let's
operate our massive cloud systems with this fragile feature".

We have never said that driver names will remain the same across
releases, and they have changed over time.  Device ids have also moved
from one driver to another as well, making the "control" of the device
seem to have changed names.

That does not mean that this is the correct api to use at all.  Again,
this was a debugging aid, to help with users who wanted to add a device
id to a driver without having to rebuild it.  Don't make it something
that it was never intended to be.

Why not just make a new api as you are doing something new here?  That
way you get to define it to work exactly the way you need?

You mean "real" solutions :)

It's not my requirement to say "here is C", but rather I am saying "B is
not going to scale over time as GUIDs are a pain to manage".

Why prevent it?  Why not just have a special api just for drivers that
want to use this new feature?
