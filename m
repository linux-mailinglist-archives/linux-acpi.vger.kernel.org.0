I believe I said "discardable" should be implied from the compatible,
not be a discreet property.

It is possible that some region is passed thru to multiple stages and
is only discardable by the last stage (or next to last or...). So
discardable depends on the consumer. There has to be some logic of "I
know what this foo-bar region is for and know it isn't needed". If the
consumer doesn't know what the region is, then it must default to
leaving it reserved.

That is the expectation though nothing prevents a platform from
omitting areas. Most likely only the beginning or end of memory.
System partitioning usecases likely just describe each partition's
portion of memory. I don't recall ever seeing a bunch of memory
regions rather than 1-2 with reserved-memory nodes.

Also, I don't think we prevent a reserved region outside the memory
region(s) though I imagine (at least Linux) just ignores them.

> Are you thinking of SRAM, etc?

We have mmio-sram binding for that which has its own way to carve up
the regions.
