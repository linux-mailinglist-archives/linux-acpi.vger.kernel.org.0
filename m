Thanks for the testing and feedback, much appreciated!

I'm going to queue up the patches that you have tested with a
Tested-by tag from you if that's not an issue.

Also patches [3/7] ("PCI: PM: Drop struct pci_platform_pm_ops") and
[7/7] ("PCI: PM: Simplify acpi_pci_power_manageable()") are not likely
to introduce functional issue, because the former removes unused code
and the latter simply rearranges some computations, so I'm going to
queue up these two as well.

Patches [4-5/7] change behavior, if only slightly, so they need to be
double checked.

In turn, patch [6/7[ contains a bug - it makes
pci_platform_power_transition() call acpi_pci_set_power_state()
instead of platform_pci_set_power_state() which is probably why you
see the problem (nobody with an ACPI platform of any platform other
then MID would see it).  Sorry about that.

After queuing up the patches that are not problematic I'll prepare a
new 3-patch series to test on top of them.

Thanks!
