the willingness and acceptance you showed during my pain have decided
to willingly compensated you and show my gratitude to you with these
sum of $950,000.00 Nine Hundred and fifty Thousand US Dollars).

I want you to accept this amount it=E2=80=99s from the bottom of my heart,
have issued the check and instructed the bank to roll the fund on a
master card for security reasons, you can use the card to withdraw
money from any ATM machine worldwide with a maximum of US$10,000 per
day.
