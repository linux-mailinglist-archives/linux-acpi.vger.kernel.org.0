I see your point and the meaning is okay... except that drivers don't
touch disabled nodes. If a device (with some address space) is disabled,
you do not write there "please be power off". Here the case is a bit
different, because I think ports do not have their own address space.
Yet it contradicts the logic - something is disabled in DT and you
expect to perform actual operations on it.

The binding asks to describe all the ports, not describe and disable them.

True, that's not specific, but as with any incomplete hardware
description in DTS, the binding cannot guarantee you
backwards-compatibility.

The hardware should be described fully in DTS and bindings expect that
as well.
