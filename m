It is as intended. The usb ports on the board will have the connector
symlink, not the devices attached to them - the firmware is only aware
of the connectors on the board of course. It looks like this series is
working as it should.

If you want to extend this solution so that also every device in the
usb topology will have the link to the connector on board, then that
should be now possible, but that is out side of the scope of this
series. You need to propose that separately.

But I must ask, why can't you just walk down the topology until you
reach the on-board ports that will have the connector links?


thanks,
