Yes, sure, it is doable. It we decide that it is the way to go.

TDX Virtual Firmware Design Guide only states that "ACPI S3 (not supported
by TDX guests)".

Kernel reports in dmesg "ACPI: PM: (supports S0 S5)".

But I don't see how any state beyond S0 and S5 make sense in TDX context.
Do you?

I find it neat that adjusting ACPI code to conform the spec makes TDX
work.

Guarantees are hard.

If somebody change their mind we will get unexpected #VE and crash.
I think it is acceptable way to handle unexpected change in confidential
computing environment.

If it it the way to go, I can make a patch.

But there's no reason to have ACPI_FLUSH_CPU_CACHE_PHYS in addition to
ACPI_FLUSH_CPU_CACHE. All ACPI_FLUSH_CPU_CACHE can skip cache flush on
TDX.
