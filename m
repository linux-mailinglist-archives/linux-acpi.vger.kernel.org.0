No it was not a direct quote. However from ACPI 6.4, s6.2.12 "_PRS
(Possible Resource Settings)":
'''This optional object evaluates [...]'''

and similarly at s6.2.16 "_SRS (Set Resource Settings)"
'''This optional control method [...]'''

Yes indeed, this quote was not relevant.

The question arose while writing link devices code, so there is no platform
with missing _PRS/_SRS methods that I know.
The question was more about spec compliance and the necessity to have these
methods when legacy interrupts are not configurable.
The message above (_CRS XXX not found in _PRS) can be generated for a Juno
for instance, and the ACPI tables are at:
https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms/blob/master/Platform/ARM/JunoPkg/AcpiTables/AcpiSsdtRootPci.asl
The ACPI table need to be modified (remove _PRS and set _CRS correctly).

If the conclusion is that _PRS/_SRS are mandatory, even for hard-wired
interrupts, then the bugzilla can be closed.

Thanks for the quick answer,
Pierre
