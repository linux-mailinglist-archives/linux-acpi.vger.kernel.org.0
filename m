The cacheinfo 'id' is only unique to the level and type. It's the
type, level, and ID that gives a unique identifier:

 * struct cacheinfo - represent a cache leaf node
 * @id: This cache's id. It is unique among caches with the same (type, lev=
el).

Maybe ACPI's ID expects/allows globally unique cache IDs?

By arbitrary, I mean made up by the binding/dts author or
documentation convention (UART0, UART1, etc.). Certainly things like
clock IDs are often made up number spaces, but I don't see how we
avoid that. DT had 'cell-index' which I still see attempted. But that
property traces back to h/w having a single power ctrl register and
cell-index was the bit index for the register. If only h/w was still
that simple.
