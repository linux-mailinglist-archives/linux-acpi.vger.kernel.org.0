Same goes for Linux AFAICT. The ones needed this actually used S0ix so
the bit should definitely be set.

It is not just Apollo Lake, but all "modern" systems as well (sorry if
this was unclear). Apollo Lake just was the first one that needed this.
We also have the Low Power S0 Idle bit set in recent systems too.
