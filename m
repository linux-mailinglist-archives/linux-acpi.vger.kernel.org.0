+1, may be look at the thread here[1], it make it clear that it is in
QEMU which I missed clearly for a while. You need to emphasize the fact
that this would happen only when the processor nodes are at the end
of the PPTT and they have no private resources(which is generally the
case in emulation as Rafaek explains below.

I completely agree.
