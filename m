We hoped we could comply with the specs, given that we were starting
from a clean slate (and not from ACPI tables cut and paste)

Yes. We would end up with that register space in the host bridge memory
windows - this does not sound right.

By the look of it the answer is yes, Windows was not bootstrapped on
those platforms given that I *assume* Windows does not discriminate
between producer and consumer resources at all.
