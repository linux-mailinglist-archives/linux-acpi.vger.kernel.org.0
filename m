Have studied _DSM method, two issues we met comparing using quirk.

1. Need change definition of either pci_host_bridge or pci_dev, like 
adding member can_stall,
while pci system does not know stall now.

a, pci devices do not have uuid: uuid need be described in dsdt, while 
pci devices are not defined in dsdt.
     so we have to use host bridge.

b,  Parsing dsdt is in in pci subsystem.
Like drivers/acpi/pci_root.c:
        obj = acpi_evaluate_dsm(ACPI_HANDLE(bus->bridge), 
&pci_acpi_dsm_guid, 1,
                                 IGNORE_PCI_BOOT_CONFIG_DSM, NULL);

After parsing DSM in pci, we need record this info.
Currently, can_stall info is recorded in iommu_fwspec,
which is allocated in iommu_fwspec_init and called by 
iort_iommu_configure for uefi.

2. Guest kernel also need support sva.
Using quirk, the guest can boot with sva enabled, since quirk is 
self-contained by kernel.
If using  _DSM, a specific uefi or dtb has to be provided,
currently we can useQEMU_EFI.fd from apt install qemu-efi


Thanks
