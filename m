Hi,

Thanks for looking at this.

Ok.

Yes, sure, as you deduced PFTF is a community project which aims to 
create a systemready UEFI/ACPI platform out of rpi4/rpi400/cm4 systems. 
Its actually fairly far along in that goal, and is capable of booting a 
wide range of arm64 based OS's & Hypervisors. Its acting like a proof of 
concept that putting effort into some basic platform abstractions 
reduces the effort to boot off the shelf OSs. It does this by moving 
much of the platform specific code into firmware.

Sure, that gets at what appears to be the fundamental problem with this 
bridge, mainly that the HW doesn't appear to be able to handle missing 
config TLP completions in a way that can be recovered.

So, if one loses the race here (and the window is much larger in the DT 
config accessor) the machine takes what is basically an unrecoverable 
exception. I will update the comment to that effect.
