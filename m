Is this something that should apply to plug-in drives, or does this
only apply to soldered-in things?

What is this BIOS work around?  Is there a defect here that's being
worked around?  What's the defect?

I guess this means that by changing the driver policy from the
default, we can save some power?

There is surprisingly little information in this intro.  The whole
paragraph under "Modern Standby Power Management" is duplicated
immediately below in "D3 Support".  Maybe that's a copyediting error
that displaced useful information.

It says "drivers should go to the deepest appropriate state" so
"function drivers don't have to manage implementation details".  No
doubt "drivers" and "function drivers" is a meaningful distinction to
Windows cognoscenti, but it's not to me.

It talks about "enabling D3" without specifying D3hot or D3cold.

It talks about "D3 support for storage devices."  All PCI devices are
required to support both D3hot and D3cold, so this must be talking
about some other sort of support; I suppose maybe it's a hint about
whether a driver should *use* D3hot (or D3cold, I can't tell).

It says nothing about where to look for the _DSD: on a Root Port or on
the NVMe endpoint.
