Greetings:

Thank you for connecting on LinkedIn from where I got your contact details.
I hope that this email meets you well. I have been given authority to
appoint a reliable international investment manager to reinvest an
inheritance of my client, to generate a targeted annual ROI of 3.5%.

I am hoping that we can build the understanding to cooperate in this
deal for mutual benefit. My client is offering 10% of the total
investment value to the investment initiators which will be you, and
me.

You will need to confirm your understanding, that the 10%
compensation/commission will be shared in the ratio of 5%-5% between
us.

The investor's attorney will prepare an agreement to confirm the
statement above to enable us have mutual understanding and stands in
this investment cooperation. I will look forward to hear from you.

On your positive response,I will present you to my client, as the
investment manager for her inheritance, into a profitable field that
will generate the expected ROI.


Let me know if we can work together.

Sincere Regards,

Mr Ian Gaylard
