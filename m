From my side, ideally this will be empty, but it may be needed to make
things work.

The DT spec says:

>>>>>
3.5.4 /reserved-memory and UEFI
When booting via [UEFI], static /reserved-memory regions must also be
listed in the system memory map obtained
via the GetMemoryMap() UEFI boot time service as defined in [UEFI] =C2=A7
7.2. The reserved memory regions need to be
included in the UEFI memory map to protect against allocations by UEFI
applications.
<<<<<

To my reading, that means that the requirement is that the
/reserved-memory regions must be returned from the GetMemoryMap() call
too. I don't see it saying that the reserved-memory regions must be
empty, though.

We would like to use a single schema, which is dtschema. UPL
validation will eventually check this, so it needs to be correct.
