Oh, I just did some initial digging through the source code and indeed on EFI
there is no actual e820 memory map at all instead it gets faked to be able
to re-use the BIOS boot based e820 code in the kernel by do_add_efi_memmap()
from arch/x86/platform/efi/efi.c .

And that does:

		switch (md->type) {
		...
                default:
                        /*
                         * EFI_RESERVED_TYPE EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES_CODE
                         * EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES_DATA EFI_MEMORY_MAPPED_IO
                         * EFI_MEMORY_MAPPED_IO_PORT_SPACE EFI_PAL_CODE
                         */
                        e820_type = E820_TYPE_RESERVED;
                        break;

Which seems to be the root cause of the problems, at least on the Yoga C940,
but I expect on the others too (will try to get that confirmed).

So yes this seems like a very promising solution direction actually.
I will try to see if I can find a test-machine here in my home office
with an EFI memmap entry with a MMIO type and then see if I can come
up with a patch to make arch_remove_reservations() not exclude those
areas.

Regards,

Hans
