Minor question about a preceding paragraph that ends:

  In that case, the ``->complete`` callback will be invoked directly
  after the ``->prepare`` callback and is entirely responsible for
  putting the device into a consistent state as appropriate.

What does" a consistent state as appropriate" mean?  I know this is
generic documentation at a high level, so maybe there's no good
explanation for "consistent state," but I don't know what to imagine
there.

And what does "as appropriate" mean?  Would it change the meaning to
drop those two words, or are there situations where it's not
appropriate to put the device into a consistent state?  Or maybe it's
just that the type of device determines what the consistent state is?

s/consequenty/consequently/

Drive-by comment: I looked for a definition of "direct-complete".  The
closest I found is a couple paragraphs above this, where it says "Note
that this direct-complete procedure ...," but that leaves me to try to
reconstruct the definition from the preceding text.

AFAICT, going to freeze, standby, or memory sleep includes these
callbacks:

  ->prepare
  ->suspend
  ->suspend_late
  ->suspend_noirq
  ->complete         (not mentioned in the list of phases)

And "direct-complete" means we skip the suspend, suspend_late,
and suspend_noirq callbacks so we only use these:

  ->prepare
  ->complete

And apparently we skip those callbacks for device X if ->prepare() for
X and all its descendents returns a positive value AND they are all
runtime-suspended, except if a driver for X or a descendent sets
DPM_FLAG_NO_DIRECT_COMPLETE.
