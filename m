Please, try to research the topic before calling it 'personal judgement'.

59abd83672f7 ("drivers: base: Introducing software nodes to the firmware node framework")

(Read the first paragraph carefully.)

Let's say it's not personal, it's by design. Extending this to cover more needs
a good justification. I do not see a such.

The patch tries to tight the driver data to the device description provided by
a software node, which is 100% equivalent to the legacy board files which we
do NOT want to have. Besides that, the kernel project rule is "we do not add
the dead (unused) code".

I believe these two is quite enough to NAK patch.

You may come with a better explanation AND a user of this in the same series.
People at least can see your use case.
