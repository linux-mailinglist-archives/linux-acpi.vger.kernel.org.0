We have been working on this.  The plan was 
1) implement modified version of openspdm requester running as QEMU app to pass DOE via CXL 
    driver IOCTL’s to do DOE (DONE)
2) enhance cxl_type3.c to call openspdm responder to implement device side SPDM (NOT DONE)
3) enhance the Avery CXL Type 3 device SystemVerilog model to call opensldm 
   responder to implement device side SPDM (DONE)

Currently we run 1) and 3) using our QEMU co-sim environment.

Huai-Cheng can probably finish 2) next week so we can run entirely in QEMU stand-alone environment.
