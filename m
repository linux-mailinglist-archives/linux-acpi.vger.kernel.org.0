The OF part of this was based on Grant's suggestions.  My
understanding at that time was that this was the right thing to do for
OF and nobody told me otherwise.

3708184afc77 device property: Move FW type specific functionality to
FW specific files

However, it didn't change the "available" vs "any" behavior for OF.

Yes, it does.

If that doesn't match the cases in which it is used, I guess it can be adjusted.

I guess that the confusion is related to what "available" means for ACPI and OF.

In the ACPI case it means "this a device object corresponding to a
device that is present".  In OF it is related to the "status" property
AFAICS.
