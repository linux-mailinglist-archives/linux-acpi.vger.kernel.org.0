That sounds great. I had kinda assumed CDAT was around the corner, and
was "the other driver" I was thinking of hence the suggestion to make it
a bit more general (or alternatively ignore that and make it specific,
but you've already done the work to make it general so happy to keep
it).

BTW for what it's worth I still think it might be best to have the
notifiers return bandwidth/latency numbers. In practice though that
would actually make my life harder so I'm happy to see where the above
takes us.
