I'll be honest I've mostly forgotten my reasoning behind including that
reference.  Might have been as simple as I got lost in the renames.

I'll drop the reference.

Thanks. I'll add that (though can't check the document currently
for reasons you can probably figure out *sigh*)

Note this patch is rather tangential to patch 2 which is the one
I really need feedback on.  Whilst this appeared to be
wrong it is 'mostly harmless'.
