There's a lot of good information above, but this is the cover letter,
so it won't make it into the git history.  Can you move this
information to the relevant patches, where it will help justify the
need for the patch?

Also, if at all possible, can you arrange for the patches themselves
to be sent as *responses* to the cover letter?  This makes the series
thread nicely and makes it much easier to download and apply it.
