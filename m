If I understand correctly, the firmware noticed an error, tried to
report it to the kernel, and is complaining because the kernel isn't
ready to handle it yet.  And the reason for this patch is to reduce
these complaints from the firmware.

That doesn't seem like a very good reason for this patch.  There is
*always* a window before the kernel is ready to handle events from the
firmware.

Why is the firmware noticing these errors in the first place?  If
you're seeing these complaints regularly, my guess is that either you
have some terrible hardware or (more likely) the firmware isn't
clearing some expected error condition correctly.  For example, maybe
the Unsupported Request errors that happen while enumerating PCIe
devices are being reported.

If you register the callback function, the kernel will now start
seeing these error reports.  What happens then?  Does the kernel log
the errors somewhere?  Is that better than the current situation where
the firmware logs them?

However, I DO think that:

  - Removing acpi_hest_init() from acpi_pci_root_init(), and

  - Converting ghes_init() and sdei_init() from initcalls to explicit
    calls

are very good reasons to do something like this patch because HEST is
not PCI-specific, and IMO, explicit calls are better than initcalls
because initcall ordering is implicit and not well-defined within a
level.

I don't know whether this "HEST is not found" message is worthwhile or
not.  I don't think lack of an HEST is an error, and users may be
alarmed.  But this is an ACPI thing, so up to you and Rafael.

Previously, if "ghes_disable", we returned immediately.  After this
patch, if "ghes_disable", we print "GHES is not enabled!\n", but then
we go on to call ghes_nmi_init_cxt() and register the
&ghes_platform_driver.  That looks wrong.  Maybe you meant to keep a
"return" here?

Why do you set ghes_disable here?  As far as I can tell, we will never
look at it again.  The places we do look at it are:

  - ghes_init(): earlier in this function, so we've already done that,

  - acpi_hest_init(): we've already called that, too, and

  - acpi_bus_osc_negotiate_platform_control(): called from
    acpi_bus_init(), which we've already called.

sdei_init() and ghes_init() stick out here because they're the only
functions without an "acpi_" prefix.  Maybe a separate patch to rename
them?

This #include looks like it may no longer be necessary.

I don't think this #include is necessary.
