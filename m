It all depends on how often each of them is going to be used in the
given driver.

This particular driver only needs a struct acpi_device pointer if I'm
not mistaken.

There is no convention in this respect and there is always a tradeoff
between using more memory and using more CPU time in computing in
general, but none of them should be wasted just for the sake of
following a convention.

So I'm only talking about the driver modified by the patch at hand.

Well, if the only thing you need from a struct device is its
ACPI_COMPANION(), it is better to store a pointer to the latter.
