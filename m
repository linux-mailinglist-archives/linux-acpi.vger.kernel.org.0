OK, but I'm not sure what you are looking for here. The DT (as
currently specified) is an incomplete description of memory, for
EFI-type firmware. I recall the ePAPR thing, but not much else. Any
pointers?

Yes, Ron pointed me to that...although it isn't quite the same thing.
That is implementing a way to pass SMBIOS and ACPI tables through to
Linux, right? But it does mention memory types, so I'll send a new
version with those people on cc, in case they don't look at linux-acpi
much.

But note, this is for *firmware* (on both sides of the interface).
Whether it is useful for Linux is another question. But in any case,
we should avoid having things in the DT which Linux cannot validate /
parse.

I suppose I'm just confused about how the schema is described. I think
it is better to have a /memory-map node with subnodes of that for each
region.

I don't see that in the schema, but given what you say, it is
definitely an option.

If the reserved-memory node hiding somewhere?

Yes I think so. I wasn't sure if adding it there would break things,
but it seems not.

I collected email addresses from that thread as best I could, and will
cc them on v3.
