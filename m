Yes, it is technically possible to take a lock from a driver. However, 
from a higher perspective, we have a core framework which is 
self-contained and we have a back-end which forces us to export this lock.

Even if it is possible, it is not desirable because we break the 
self-containment and thus that will make future changes in the core 
framework complicated because of the interactions with back-end drivers.

I'm not putting in question your changes in general but just want to 
keep the direction of having the core framework and the drivers 
interacting with the ops and a few high level functions where the core 
framework handle the logic.

The clocksource/clockevent drivers are an example on how the time 
framework and the drivers are clearly separated.

The function thermal_zone_set_trip() takes the lock.
