Is the latest version of this.  For basic testing Ben's qemu branch should
work for you. 
https://gitlab.com/bwidawsk/qemu/-/commits/cxl-2.0v4/

Note there are some big questions over the approach used for integrating
this with the PCI subsystem (auxiliary bus vs library) which I'm not sure
we've reached a conclusion on yet.

One minor thing on the wish list is lspci support to at least identify the
presence of a DOE.  I have patches for that and will send out fairly soon
once I've cleared a backlog of other stuff.

My main focus right now is on resolving some of the opens around the
QEMU support for CXL emul in general, but I haven't touched the DOE stuff
beyond rebasing.  *fingers crossed* I should have an updated qemu tree
out sometime in next week or so.

Thanks,

Jonathan
