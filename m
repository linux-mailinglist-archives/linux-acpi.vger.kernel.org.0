No, you aren't.

Why not?

Why would it need that information in this particular format?

That doesn't have to be the case.

However, things linke cpuidle have been invented to provide user space
interfaces for features that previously were only available on systems
with ACPI.  Why is _PLD different?

Again, why would it need that information?

What additional details do you mean?

Why can't we?
