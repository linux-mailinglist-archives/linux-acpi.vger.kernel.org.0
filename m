Taking a struct acpi_device pointer as the first argument is part of
duplication reduction, however, because in the most common case it
saves the users of it the need to dereference the struct acpi_device
they get from ACPI_COMPANION() in order to obtain the handle.

Arguably, acpi_handle is an ACPICA concept and it is better to reduce
its usage outside ACPICA.

I'm not sure what you mean.  This patch is changing existing functions.

No, if the user has a pointer to struct acpi_device already, there is
no difference between passing this and passing the acpi_handle from it
except for the extra dereference in the latter case.

If the user doesn't have a struct acpi_device pointer, let them use
the raw ACPICA handler directly and worry about the synchronization
themselves.

The wrappers are there to cover the most common case, not to cover all case=
s.

What duplicate code do you mean, exactly?

IMV you haven't really explained why this particular patch is
necessary or even useful.

Thanks!
