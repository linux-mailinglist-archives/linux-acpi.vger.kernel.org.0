I agree, I am also wondering why an (ARM) SError was considered an appropriate answer in the first place. Maybe it's due to some confusion between the ARM architecture term "SError" and the PCI #SERR signal?

Yes, "System Error" in PCI lingo is definitely something different and unrelated to the ARM architecture SError.
I also checked the (legacy) PCI command register, the PCIe baseline error handling and AER, all of them seem to not propagate the SERR signal. So I reckon it's something which does this on the root complex integration level, outside of generic PCIe. So far I also couldn't find a masking bit in the RC data sheet as well.

There is, on this core, but it becomes even more dodgy: While you can *block* delivery of an SError (by setting PSTATE.A), you couldn't clear it so far. ARMv8.2 introduced the "esb" instruction, which allows us to actually consume the SError, so clearing the A bit afterwards would continue operation as normal. This particular core supports v8.2, but the Rockchip SoC does not. So it would not help in the general case, also has that bitter taste of possibly masking an unrelated SError.

So I managed to hack some proof of concept up where I can indeed fence in the SError around the config space access, within the kernel, so I can *almost* certainly say whether this readl/readw triggered this. But that would require aarch64 specific code (even instructions that require an ARMv8.2 compatible core) in the PCI driver, and so is probably more ugly than the existing solution. Plus we would need to iron out the remaining uncertainty, not sure that's actually possible.

Cheers,
Andre.
