Well, it was quite a few years ago.

IIRC, the idea was to avoid requesting native control of anything PCIe
if those bits were not set in the mask, because otherwise we wouldn't
be able to get PME and native hotplug control which were not
configurable at that time.  [PME is still not configurable and
potentially related to hotplug, because they may use the same MSI IRQ
in principle, but the native hotplug is configurable now anyway.]

That'd be reasonable IMO.

Right.

Note that if we don't request the native control of a PCIe feature,
this basically gives the BIOS a licence to scribble on the related
device registers and some of the features are not independent, so we
may need to advertise support for two features in order to get control
of just one of them.
