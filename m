I booted with the pcie_aspm=3Doff kernel parameter, which means that
PCIe Active State Power Management (ASPM) is disabled. Given this
context, should I consider removing this setting to see if it affects
the occurrence of the Bus Check notifications and the BAR0 reset
issue?

From the kernel driver or user space tools, is it possible to
determine whether the device has been reset or powered down?
Are there any power management settings or configurations that could
be causing the device to reset or power down unexpectedly?

The PCIe device in question is a Xilinx FPGA endpoint, which is
flashed with RTL code to expose several host interfaces to the system
via the PCIe link.

We have an out-of-tree driver for this device, but to eliminate the
driver's role in this issue, I renamed the driver to prevent it from
loading automatically after rebooting the machine. Despite not using
the driver, the issue still occurred.
