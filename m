Thank you!

I have been resisting DMI quirks but I'm afraid there's no other way.
I think the web we've gotten into, where vendors have used E820 to
interact with _CRS in incompatible and undocumented ways, is not
sustainable.

I'm not aware of any spec that says the OS should use E820 to clip
things out of _CRS, so I think the long term plan should be to
decouple them by default.

Straw man:

  - Disable E820 clipping by default.

  - Add a quirk to enable E820 clipping for machines older than X,
    e.g., 2023, to avoid breaking machines that currently work.

  - Add quirks to disable E820 clipping for individual machines like
    the Lenovo and Clevos that predate X, but E820 clipping breaks
    them.

  - Add quirks to enable E820 clipping for individual machines like
    the Chromebooks (and probably machines we don't know about yet)
    that have devices that consume part of _CRS but are not
    enumerable.

  - Communicate this to OEMs to try to prevent future machines that
    need quirks.
