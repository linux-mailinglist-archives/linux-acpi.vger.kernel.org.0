Agreed. The question is WHAT runtime-code? The compatible needs to answer t=
hat.

For example, we have 'ramoops' as a compatible in reserved memory.
That tells us *exactly* what's there. We know how to parse it. If we
know ramoops is not supported, then we know we can toss it out and
reclaim the memory.

I don't see why we need that indirection.

This section is purely about using UEFI mechanisms to load and boot
the OS. If we're not talking about this stage of booting, then none of
this applies.
