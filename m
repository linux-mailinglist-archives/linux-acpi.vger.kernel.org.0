The feedback I got for the PCI V1 was to make it as minimal as
possible. We agree preserving the BUS MASTER bit is the first minimal
step. That is what I did in the V2 phase I series. Only the bus
master. I think the pci-lu-test driver did demo the bus master bit, it
is not vfio yet. At least that was the plan shared in the upstream
alignment meeting.

SR-IOV is a much bigger step than the BUS Master bit. I recall at one
point in the upstream discussion meeting that we don't do SR-IOV as
the first step. I am not opposed to it, we need to get to vfio and
SR-IOV eventually. I just feel that the PCI + VFIO + SR-IOV will be a
much bigger series. I worry the series size is not friendly for
reviewers. I wish there could be smaller incremental steps digestible.

Yes doable, just will delay the LUO/PCI series by a bit and a much
bigger series.

You have me on the double negatives, always not very good at those.
If the bigger series is what we want, I can do that. Just will have
some latency to get the VFIO.

Your VF device does not need to preserve DMA? If you want to preserve
DMA the bus master bit is required, and the pcieport driver for the
PCI-PCI bridge is also required. I am not sure pure VF and PF without
any DMA makes practical sense.
