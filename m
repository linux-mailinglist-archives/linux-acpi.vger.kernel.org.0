PCI devices aren't necessarily described in the ACPI namespace and we
still use IORT to describe them - through the RC node.

I think you can read this multiple ways but this patch does not
change this concept. What changes, is applying parent's node IORT
mapping to child nodes with no associated DSDT nodes, it is the
same thing we do with PCI and the _DMA method - we could update
the wording in the specs if that clarifies but I don't think this
deliberately disregards the specifications.

I assume so why wouldn't it be ? Why would be describe them in
a parent-child relationship if that's not how the system looks like
in HW ?

Do you have a specific example in mind that we should be aware of ?

I think that's a matter of wording, it can be updated if it needs be,
reach out if you see any issue with the current approach please.

Thanks,
