You completely fail to describe the failure mode.

This sentence makes no sense. What's so special about maxcpus=1?

Absolutely nothing.

lapic_resume() is a syscore op and is always invoked on the CPU which
handles suspend/resume. The point is that __x2apic_enable() which is
invoked from there becomes a NOOP because X2APIC is already enabled.

So what are you trying to tell me?

I really appreciate your enthusiasm of chasing and fixing bugs, but your
change logs and explanations are really making it hard to keep that
appreciation up.

The x2apic comment is misplaced. It should be above the x2apic
conditional as it has nothing to do with the initial condition because
even if X2APIC is enabled then the parallel startup might be disabled.

Go and read this comment 3 month from now and try to make sense of it.

This bit is sticky after resume, so any subsequent CPU hotplug operation
will see it as well.

This lacks an explanation why this is correct and why this flag is not
set early during boot before the APs are brought up.

Why is this tested here? The test clearly belongs into .Lread_apicid

And this part just moves in front of .Lread_apicid_msr and spares
the jump at the end.

That aside, I'm still failing to see the actual failure scenario due to
the utter void in the change log.

The kernel has two mechanisms which end up with X2APIC enabled:

    1) BIOS has it enabled already, which is required for any machine
       which has more than 255 CPUs, but BIOS can decide to enable
       X2APIC even with less than 256 CPUs.

    2) BIOS has not enabled it, but the kernel enables it because the
       CPU supports it.

The major difference is:

    #1 prevents the MMIO fixmap for the APIC to be installed

    #2 installs the fixmap but does not use it. It's never torn down.

Let's look at these two cases in the light of resume:

    #1 If the BIOS enabled X2APIC mode then the only way how this can
       fail on resume is that the BIOS did not enable X2APIC mode in the
       resume path before going back into the kernel and due to the
       non-existent MMIO mapping there is no way to read the APIC ID.

    #2 It does not matter whether the BIOS enabled X2APIC mode during
       resume because the MMIO mapping exists and the APIC ID read via
       MMIO should be identical to the APIC ID read via the X2APIC MSR.

       If not, then there is something fundamentally wrong.

How is this working during the initial bringup of the APs?

    #1 If the APs do not have X2APIC enabled by the BIOS then they will
       crash and burn during bringup due to non-existent MMIO mapping.

    #2 The APs can read their APIC ID just fine via MMIO and it
       obviously is the same as the APIC ID after the bringup enabled
       X2APIC mode. Otherwise the kernel would not work at all.

So the only reasonable explanation for the failure is that the BIOS
fails to reenable X2APIC mode on resume either on the CPU which handles
suspend/resume or on the subsequent AP bringups, which is not clear at
all due to the bit being sticky and the changelog being full of void in
that aspect.

That said the sticky bit is wrong for the following case with older CPUs
where X2APIC requires up to date microcode loaded to work correctly:

    boot maxcpus=4
      load microcode    // Same sequence applies for AP (CPU1-3)
      enable x2apic
    suspend
       set X2APIC enable bit in smpboot_control
    resume
    bringup CPU4
       enable X2APIC early --> fail due to lack of microcode fix

Whether this affects the APIC ID readout or not, which we don't know and
even if we consider this case to be academic, it's still fundamentally
wrong from a correctness point of view.

So without proper information about the failure scenario this "fix" is
simply going nowhere.

Please provide the following information:

  - dmesg of the initial boot up to 'smp: Bringing up secondary CPUs ...'

  - A proper description of the failure case:

    - Is the CPU which handles suspend/resume failing?

    - Is a subsequent AP bringup failing?

    - Is the failure due to the lack of MMIO mapping ?

    - Is the failure due to a bogus APIC ID retrieved via MMIO ?

Thanks for making me do your homework (again),

        tglx
