To keep everyone updated, Mika has helped me initiate a conversation
with Microsoft on this (Thanks a lot Mika!). We're still waiting to
hear their feedback. Until then, I've posted a v2 for review at:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-pci/patch/20220202020103.2149130-1-rajatja@google.com/

If we can reach an agreement with Microsoft, I can change the property
name in the patch (to "DmaProperty"), but would appreciate review of
any other aspects of v2 in the meantime.

Thanks & Best Regards,

Rajat
