Urgh, seems my mistake was assuming exynos_defconfig was the right thing 
to begin from - bcb81ac6ae3c with that still dies in the same way (this 
time I saw a hint of spin_bug() being hit...), however a 
multi_v7_defconfig build does get to userspace OK again with no obvious 
signs of distress:

[root@alarm ~]# grep -Hr . /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/*/type
/sys/kernel/iommu_groups/0/type:identity
/sys/kernel/iommu_groups/1/type:identity
/sys/kernel/iommu_groups/10/type:identity
/sys/kernel/iommu_groups/2/type:identity

Annoyingly I do have an adapter for the fiddly micro-HDMI, but it's at 
home :(

On a hunch I stuck a print in exynos_iommu_probe_device(), and it looks 
like in fact device_link_add() isn't getting called at all, and indeed 
your symptoms do sound like they could be explained by the IOMMU not 
being reliably resumed... lemme stare at exynos_iommu_of_xlate() a bit 
longer...

Thanks,
Robin.
