Note these are for PCIe which is not the same as the paraller PCI.

What I mean here is that there is some sort of wake depending whether
the link is in L1 or L2/L3 and then resulting the link to go to L0 and
PME message being send over to the root complex.

Right.

> Are we talking about D3hot or D3cold?

My interpretation is that both (D3 implies both D3hot and D3cold) but I
did not write that spec.

Systems where this is used typically go down to D3cold with the PCIe
topology (links are in L2).

Well you always need some platform (ACPI) help in order to even to
D3cold. This applies to waking up as well. The PCIe device may advertise
that it supports this but I don't think it can be sure that the system
it is connected to has this plumbing.

For PCIe hotplug ports there have been issues that have prevented doing
power management for those. The _DSD is there to provide a hint to the
OS saying that yeah, this port actually is expected to work even if it
goes into D3 (cold/hot).

You always need help from platform (ACPI) to get into D3cold.

Well, there won't be any new MID devices and the only one we support
partially is Edison and it does not have a single PCIe port that could
even be power managed.

No objections :)

However, in order to make this more maintainable, what if we check in
the platform_pci_bridge_d3() itself whether the pointer is NULL and
return false? That would work for any future platforms and avoid adding
the dummy implementation each time.
