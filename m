Yes, thanks Arnd

_DSM may not workable, since it is working in runtime.
We need stall information in init stage, neither too early (after 
allocation of iommu_fwspec)
nor too late (before arm_smmu_add_device ).

By the way,
It would be a long time if we need modify either pcie spec or acpi spec.
Can we use pci_fixup_device in iommu_fwspec_init first, it is relatively 
simple
and meet the requirement of platform device using pasid, and they are 
already in product.

Thanks
