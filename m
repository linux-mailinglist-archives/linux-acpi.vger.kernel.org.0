The spec says "Describes the IO relationships between devices
represented in the ACPI namespace.", and in section 3.1.1.3 Named
component node, it says:

"Named component nodes are used to describe devices that are also
included in the Differentiated System Description Table (DSDT). See
[ACPI]."

So from my understanding, the IORT spec for now, can only do ID
translations for devices in the DSDT.

For example, device A is not described in DSDT so can't represent
as a NC node in IORT. Device B can be described in DSDT and it
is the parent of device A, so device B can be represented in IORT
with memory access properties and node flags with Substream width
and Stall supported info.

When we trying to translate device A's ID, we reuse all the memory
access properties and node flags from its parent (device B), but
will it the same?

So the IORT spec don't support this, at least it's pretty vague
I think.

Thanks
