It was unsure which of the 2 models described in ACPI 6.4, s6.2.13
"_PRT (PCI Routing Table)" would be used for UEFI for kvmtool.

Remainder:
The first model allows to accurately describe interrupts: level/edge
triggered and active high/low. Interrupts are also configurable with
_CRS/_PRS/_SRS/_DIS methods
The second model allows to describe hardwired interrupts, and are
by default level triggered, active low.

The kernel is aware that GivV2 interrupts are active high, so there
was actually no need to accurately describe them. Thus the second
model was used.
While experimenting, we temporarily had a configuration using
the first model, and only had a _CRS method (no _PRS/_SRS), which
triggered some warnings.

So these patches are not fixes for existing platforms, but merely
to make _PRS/_SRS methods optional.

In [1] I said I would submit patches to change that. If you think
this is not necessary as the configuration is non-existing, I am
perfectly fine to drop the patches.

Also as Rafael noted, the _DIS method should also be taken into
consideration if _PRS/_SRS are made optional.

Regards,
Pierre
