The CRB driver is currently probed based on ACPI, but it fundamentally
doesn't have to be.  If there was a DT binding for CRB-based
TPMs the different start methods would be defined there and the
CRB driver could support that.

The CRB is just a shared memory buffer, with some architected semantics
defined by TCG. The basic CRB usage model is that a client puts
something in the CRB, such as the bytes of a TPM command, and then
notifies the TPM that a change was made to the CRB. The CRB over
FF-A spec just defines the message to perform that notification
when FF-A is used.

So, whether the fTPM was advertised via ACPI or DT, it doesn't matter.
The FF-A based interface is only about the the notification messages
needed for the OS driver to tell the TPM that something has changed
in the CRB.

Thanks,
Stuart
