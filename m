Yes. the CXL.io protocol is synonymous with PCIe. Hotplug is native
PCIe hotplug to negotiate getting the card online and offline.
Although, for offline an additional constraint is to deny removal
whenever the card has active pages in the page allocator. Similar to
what happens today for ACPI memory hotplug where the OS can say "nope,
there's still active pages in the range you asked to eject".

FLR has no effect on CXL.cache or CXL.mem state, only CXL.io.

A memory interleave can span any level of the hierarchy. It can be
across host bridges at the top level, but also incorporate a leaf
device at the bottom of a CXL switch hierarchy. There will be a
cxl_port instance for each side of each link.

Per CXL Spec:

"FLR has no effect on the CXL.cache and CXL.mem protocol. Any
CXL.cache and CXL.mem related control registers including CXL DVSEC
structures and state held by the CXL device are not affected by FLR.
The memory controller hosting the HDM is not reset by FLR."

No ACPI hotplug is not involved. ACPI0017 is essentially just a dummy
anchor device to hang the interleave set coordination. The connect
from native hotplug to CXL is the cxl_mem driver. When that it detects
a new device it walks the cxl_port hierarchy to see if one is a parent
of this endpoint. Then it registers its HDM decoders with the CXL core
and the CXL core can online it as a standalone interneleave set or
consolidate it with others to make a wider set. For persistent memory
there is on-device metadata to recall whether this device was part of
a set previously. For volatile-only devices it would need to rely on
some policy to decide if devices are immediately onlined standalone,
or wait for an administrator to configure them.

Correct.

ACPI0017 will communicate a set of address spaces that the CXL core
can allocate interleave sets.

Correct. For example a PCIe switch could disable all I/O space and
Memory (MMIO) space, but still decode Host-managed Device Memory (HDM)
space.

A bit of both. The cxl_mem driver does pci_register_driver(), but for
ports there will be a driver on the CXL bus for that component
capability. Both endpoints and switches will produce cxl_port
instances to be connected / driven by a core driver and coordinated
with a root level driver for address space and interleave management.

Right, I'm hoping like FLR there is little need to coordinate PCI /
CXL.io operations with CXL.mem operations, or that once a PCI driver
registers some CXL capabilities it never needs to look back. The only
hook that violates this so far is NAKing device removal when CXL.mem
for that device is busy.

auxiliary-bus is not a specific thing, it's a generic way for any
driver to register a custom device for a sub-driver to drive. One of
the primary examples are PCI Ethernet drivers exporting RDMA device
interfaces for common RDMA functionality. So you could have multiple
generations of Ethernet devices all producing a common RDMA interface
and rather than have an equivalent RDMA driver per generation just
create a shared common one that attaches to all the different baseline
Ethernet implementations.

See:

Documentation/driver-api/auxiliary_bus.rst

That document is still a bit too generic, and I have an item on my
backlog to flesh it out with more practical guidelines.

Auxiliary-bus might help especially if those unrelated pieces have
been duplicated across multiple different device implementations.
Aux-bus might clean up the driver model for those pieces.
