Critical error on my part here: the E820 map is passed to Linux by the
bootloader or the EFI stub, NOT constructed by Linux.

Yes :)  I tried something similar and of course it didn't work because
it didn't change the E820 map coming from the bootloader.

I gave up on figuring out what went wrong in this path.

Anyway, I've had the patch below in -next for a couple weeks, but I
plan to drop it and replace it with the series here:
