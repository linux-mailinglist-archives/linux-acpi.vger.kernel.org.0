It could also occur due to suspend_test. Additionally with new
notifier we could get notification when the system wakes up from
s2idle_loop and immediately goes to sleep again (due to e.g.
acpi_s2idle_wake condition not being met) - in this case relying on
prepare_late callback is not possible since it is not called in this
path.

Since this whole patchset is aimed at notifying the host about a guest
entering s2idle state, reaching this step can be considered as a
suspend "entry point" for VM IMO. It is because we are talking about
the vCPU not the real CPU. Therefore it seems to me, that even if some
other vCPUs could still get some wakeup signal they will not be able
to kick (through s2idle_wake->swake_up_one(&s2idle_wait_head);) the
original vCPU which entered s2idle_loop, triggered the new notifier
and is halted due to handling vCPU exit (and was about to trigger
swait_event_exclusive). So it will prevent the VM's resume process
from being started.

Too late to cancel the host suspend process, which thinks that the VM
is in s2idle state while it isn't.

At the moment when VM triggers this new notifier we trap on MMIO
access and the VMM handles vCPU exit (so the vCPU is "halted").
Therefore the VMM could control when it finishes such handling and
releases the vCPU again.

Maybe adding some more context will be helpful. This patchset was
aimed for two different scenarios actually:
1) Host is about to enter the suspend state and needs first to suspend
VM with all pass-through devices. In this case the host waits for
s2idle notification from the guest and when it receives it, it
continues with its own suspend process.
2) Guest could be a "privileged" one (in terms of VMM) and when the
guest enters s2idle state it notifies the host, which in turn triggers
the suspend process of the host.

In a way, yes, we compensate for the lack of something like PM1_CNT to
trap on for detecting that the guest is suspending.
We could instead force the guest to use S3 but IMO it is undesirable,
since it generally does make a difference which suspend mode is used
in the guest, s2idle or S3, e.g some drivers check which suspend type
is used and based on that behaves differently during suspend. One of
the example is:
