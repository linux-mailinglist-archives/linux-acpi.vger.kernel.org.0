I will reword it a bit.

That is the "linux,pci-quirk" in the next patch.

This check is intended to verify that something is plugged into the 
first bus/slot before attempting to probe it. If nothing is plugged in 
bad things (TM) happen without this check.

But, you sparked my curiosity. I've had some reasonable luck with error 
recovery with a number of those cheap pcie->pcie switches that passively 
route PCIe over USB3 cables when plugged into this thing. So, I tried 
hotpluging the first one to see what happens.

Game over!  :)

Linux was nice enough to tell me it couldn't change the power state back 
to active, but it looks like the link state actually recovered. OTOH, 
the downstream switch appeared to need reconfiguration even though it 
was on a separate power domain. Given, I booted the machine off a NVMe 
drive plugged into that switch, I got another nice screen full of blk_mq 
errors before it officially passed on.

So, the link appears to recover, but that doesn't appear to be enough to 
make the downstream devices recoverable.

Thanks,
