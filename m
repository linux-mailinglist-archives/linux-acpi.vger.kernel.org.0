For such a simple change which several parties are interested in,
I think it would be better to move it to the front of the series.

Patch [1/4] looks like an optimization (using a cached value)
which this patch doesn't depend on.  Patch [2/4] looks like a
change of bikeshed color which isn't strictly necessary for
this fourth patch either.  If you want to propose those changes,
fine, but by making this fourth patch depend on them, you risk
delaying its acceptance.  As an upstreaming strategy it's usually
smarter to move potentially controversial or unnecessary material
to the back of the series, or submit it separately if it can be
applied standalone.

The PCI core cannot put devices into D3cold without help from the
platform.  Checking whether D3cold is possible (or allowed or
whatever) thus requires asking platform support code via
platform_pci_power_manageable(), platform_pci_choose_state() etc.

I think patch [3/4] is a little confusing because it creates
infrastructure to decide whether D3cold is supported (allowed?)
but we already have that in the platform_pci_*() functions.
So I'm not sure if patch [3/4] adds value.  I think generally
speaking if D3hot isn't possible (allowed?), D3cold is assumed
to not be possible either.

Thanks,

Lukas
