Right, the fwnode stuff works as a DT/ACPI abstraction for reading 
values from firmware tables. In this case the ACPI definition looks 
something like:

Device(PCI0) {
...
   Name (_DSD, Package () {
   ToUUID("daffd814-6eba-4d8c-8a91-bc9bbf4aa301"),
     Package () {
     Package () { "linux-pcie-quirk", "bcm2711" },
   }
   })

...
}

Which explains a bit of why the underlying code is a bit uh... complicated.
