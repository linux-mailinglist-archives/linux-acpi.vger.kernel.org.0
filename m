Better yes, because then it is for something specific. However, AIUI,
that's setup for the OS and defining that region is already defined by
the EFI memory map. That's Ard's issue. If there's a need outside of
the EFI to OS handoff, then you need to define what that usecase looks
like. Describe the problem rather than present your solution.

If this is all specific to EDK2 then it should say that rather than
'efi'. I imagine Ard would be happier with something tied to EDK2 than
*all* UEFI. Though maybe the problem could be any implementation? IDK.
Maybe it's TF-A that needs to define where the EFI runtime services
region is and that needs to be passed all the way thru to the EFI
implementation? So again, define the problem.

I think it is the same.

I think so. NVS is not a term I've heard in relation to ACPI, but that
may just be my limited ACPI knowledge.

Hard to tell that just from the name... 'boot' could be any component
involved in booting including the OS.

Why later? You have a specific use in mind and I imagine Ard has
thoughts on that.
