This should be cc'd to linus-pci and linux-acpi (added).  I only
noticed this message by accident.  And I don't see the patch at all.

pci=nocrs is for working around defects in firmware or Linux.  The
firmware knows more about the platform than Linux, and in general we
have to trust it.  We probably should taint the kernel when we use it.

Any parameter like this should work the same on all ACPI systems,
including ia64 and arm64, and should probably also taint the kernel.

I can't see the patch itself, but I'm a little confused because we
normally get the bus number range from _CRS in acpi_pci_root_add() and
your patch doesn't appear to touch that.
