You can have DT support on x86.
CONFIG_OF=y
CONFIG_PCI_DYNAMIC_OF_NODES = y

I use a PCIe board from Microchip (Lan966x) and I describe the internal board
IPs using a DT overlay.
My PCI driver loads the overlay at probe() and call of_platform_default_populate()
to instantiate the devices.

My DT overlay contains nodes for:
- clock controller
- reset
- i2c bus
- pinctrl and gpio
- Network switch
- MDIO controller

I have it working on x86 system.
What is mainly missing upstream for x86 system is the DT node creation for the
host PCI bridge (root complex). Indeed, on x86 the description comes from ACPI
and a DT description of this root bridge is needed.
Got a draft code locally (not sent upstream yet) that creates this first bridge
on ACPI based systems.

PCI-to-PCI bridges and PCI devices are already handled:
  https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9-rc5/source/drivers/pci/of.c#L625
At runtime, based on the PCI enumeration, corresponding DT nodes are created.

Best regards,
Hervé

With DT overlay, you can register any devices available on your PCI board.
You just need to describe them in the overlay and be sure that a driver exist to
handle them based on their compatible property.

Also, this solution was designed to work on both DT and ACPI based systems.
My Microchip board works on x86 and ARM.

Best regards,
Hervé
