That is true. This is more about preventing an ecosystem / cottage
industry of tooling built around bypassing the kernel. So the kernel
complains loudly and hopefully prevents vendor tooling from
propagating and instead directs that development effort back to the
native tooling. However for the rare "I know what I'm doing" cases,
this tainted kernel bypass lets some experimentation and debug happen,
but the kernel is transparent that when the capability ships in
production it needs to be a native implementation.

So it's less, "the system integrity is compromised" and more like
"you're bypassing the development process that ensures sanity for CXL
implementations that may take down a system if implemented
incorrectly". For example, NVME reset is a non-invent, CXL reset can
be like surprise removing DDR DIMM.

Should this be more tightly scoped to CXL? I had hoped to use this in
other places in LIBNVDIMM, but I'm ok to lose some generality for the
specific concerns that make CXL devices different than other PCI
endpoints.
