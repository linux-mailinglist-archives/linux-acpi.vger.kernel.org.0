I think that BIOS setting is misguided.  _OSC is designed around the
assumption that features in the Control field start out being
controlled by the platform, and they stay that way until the OS
requests control of a feature and the platform grants it.

It makes no sense to me to configure the BIOS in advance to say "the
OS controls DPC."  The BIOS has no control over what the OS will do,
and it can't behave as though the OS controls DPC until the OS
actually requests that.

I also think the warning is overly aggressive.  _OSC is clearly
designed to be evaluated multiple times, and the OS is allowed to
request control of more features each time (ACPI v6.3, sec 6.2.11.1.1,
6.2.11.1.3).
