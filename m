Effectively yes.  

The actual problem in the kernel is we 'partly' create NUMA nodes from other
sources (_PXM and others), but not completely, leaving a bunch of cases
where normal use of them will cause problems (e.g. devm memory allocations).
So I would say we don't succeed in creating the nodes and the code doesn't
prevent us from doing part of the job.  If this problem didn't exist
there would be little point in making this change.

Given the ACPI spec says we should not create nodes unless they are defined in
SRAT, the easiest way to close this existing problem down is to stop
creating those nodes. Given anyone who does this today in their firmware
generally can't boot Linux (the exception being where Linux currently ignores
specified proximity nodes), we aren't making it any worse for anyone.

The side effect being that this allows us to enable _PXM for PCI device.
(follow up patch once we have a solution to this).

I do.  I'll use something closer to your language.

Sure.  We did ask those who drew up the original spec, hence allowing us to
get at close to what the intent was. Still I agree it doesn't need to be stated here
as is probably only of historical interest.

OK.  This was added to address an earlier point you made that it was
possible that some driver was using _PXM to partly initialize a node,
for more sophisticated allocation decisions, rather than directly
using standard node allocations etc. Whilst that is complex it could
in theory have been done.  Now the driver can do that by directly
evaluating _PXM.  Given I am fairly sure no in tree drivers do this,
I'm certainly happy to drop it.

Yes. That is why I am explicitly calling out this exception to the
specification.  As things currently stand this is broken. Hence no existing
platform is doing this because they wouldn't boot.

The current patch closes down the hole, preventing this crash.  It does
it by defaulting to NO_NUMA_NODE. As you observe that is not in line with
the ACPI specification. It will not break any platforms because we know
no one is doing this (as it crashes currently).

I am more than happy to look at relaxing that restriction but it is a
separate (and currently theoretical) issue.

Yes to: won't do it.  No to: there being something in the spec.
Right now we crash.  This is a step in a better direction.

From a Linux point of view, the easiest method may be to treat an ITS as a
Generic Initiator.   I think the requirements are the same
(need a memoryless and processor less NUMA domain).

Will do.  It may also make sense to do the ITS change as a third patch
as we can then have the information about the crash etc tightly coupled
to the exact change.  I may break it up further to make it easier
to add detail on different cases.
