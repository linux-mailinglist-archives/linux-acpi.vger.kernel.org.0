Maybe state 'firmware bug workaround' a bit more clearly in this description.
I briefly wondered if there was a non buggy path to this case.

This 'may expect' seems like a nasty opening. I get that there is an oddity
if a firmware says it can do something and then when we try to ask
for that says no, but I'd be concerned that someone might have a bug
in the query instead so it promises more that is actually possible
and we grab control of things the firmware is still using with
may eat babies result.

At very least I think we should scream about any firmware that
does return an error in these cases.  You do that so I guess this
is making the best of a bad situation.

Otherwise one comment inline.

Maybe it's worth a 'Muddling on anyway' message to say that we are ignoring those
errors?
