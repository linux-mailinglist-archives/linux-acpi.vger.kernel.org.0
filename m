This should probably go into dtschema instead, but fine here now for review=
ing.

We have to consider if this property should be automatically allowed
on any node or nodes with specific suppliers, or if it should be
explicit for users. The former needs tool support. I'm leaning towards
the latter as I want to know when this is needed.

select: true

Otherwise, this is never applied.

Should be phandle-array plus:

items:
  maxItems: 1

(as each entry is a single phandle)
