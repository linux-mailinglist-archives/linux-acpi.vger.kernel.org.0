I think I would feel better if we always enabled Translation Blocking
except when we actually need it for ATS.  But I'm not confident about
how all the pieces of ATS work, so I could be missing something.

If BIOS handed off with ATS enabled and we somehow relied on it being
already enabled, something might break if we start disabling ATS.
Just a theoretical possibility, doesn't seem likely to me.
