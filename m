Dan brought this ECN [1] to my attention. We can add this if we can find 
a BIOS that implements the ECN. Or should we code a place holder for it 
until this is available?

Talked to Lukas and this may not be difficult with his latest changes. I 
can take a look. Do we support switch CDAT in QEMU yet?
