I don't think the UEFI references are needed or helpful here.

These types are used by firmware to describe the nature of certain
memory regions to the OS. Boot code and data can be discarded, as well
as ACPI reclaim after its contents have been consumed. Runtime code
and data need to be mapped for runtime features to work.

When one firmware phase communicates the purpose of a certain memory
reservation to another, it is typically not limited to whether its
needs to be preserved and when it needs to be mapped (and with which
attributes). I'd expect a memory reservation appearing under this node
to have a clearly defined purpose, and the subsequent phases need to
be able to discover this information.

For example, a communication buffer for secure<->non-secure
communication or a page with spin tables used by PSCI. None of the
proposed labels are appropriate for this, and I'd much rather have a
compatible string or some other property that clarifies the nature in
a more suitable way. Note that 'no-map' already exists to indicate
that the CPU should not map this memory unless it does so for the
specific purpose that the reservation was made for.
