Well, not quite.  ECAM doesn't *need* mutual exclusion.  Single loads
and stores are atomic by definition.

I looked through these again and found another problem case (thunder).
Here are my notes from my research.

Normal ECAM users require no device-specific support.  The platform
supplies an MCFG table, the generic code works, no mutual exclusion is
required, and APEI doesn't need to reserve the MCFG areas.

The problem cases are platforms that supply an MCFG table but require
some device-specific workarounds.  We can identify these because they
have quirks in pci-mcfg.c.  Here are the existing quirks and the
pci_ecam_ops structs they supply:

  AL_ECAM             al_pcie_ops                 # OK
  QCOM_ECAM32         pci_32b_ops                 # OK
  HISI_QUAD_DOM       hisi_pcie_ops               # OK
  THUNDER_PEM_QUIRK   thunder_pem_ecam_ops        # problem
  THUNDER_PEM_QUIRK   thunder_pem_ecam_ops        # problem
  THUNDER_ECAM_QUIRK  pci_thunder_ecam_ops        # OK
  tegra               tegra194_pcie_ops           # problem
  XGENE_V1_ECAM_MCFG  xgene_v1_pcie_ecam_ops      # problem
  XGENE_V2_ECAM_MCFG  xgene_v2_pcie_ecam_ops      # problem
  ALTRA_ECAM_QUIRK    pci_32b_read_ops            # OK

The ones marked "OK" have .map_bus(), .read(), and .write() methods
that need no mutual exclusion because they boil down to just a single
MMIO load or store.  These are fine and there shouldn't be a problem
if an EINJ action accesses the ECAM space.

The others do require mutual exclusion:

  - thunder_pem_ecam_ops: thunder_pem_config_read() calls
    thunder_pem_bridge_read(), which does a writeq() to PEM_CFG_RD
    followed by a readq().  The writeq() and readq() must be atomic to
    avoid corruption.

  - tegra194_pcie_ops: tegra194_map_bus() programs the ATU.  This and
    the subsequent ECAM read/write must be atomic.

  - xgene_v1_pcie_ecam_ops and xgene_v2_pcie_ecam_ops:
    xgene_pcie_map_bus() sets the RTID.  This and the subsequent ECAM
    read/write must be atomic.

I had to look at all these ops individually to find them, so I don't
see an easy way to identify these problem cases at run-time.

I personally would not have an issue with having APEI try to reserve
the MCFG regions for any platform that has an MCFG quirk.  That would
prevent the al, qcom, hisi, thunder-ecam, and altra drivers from using
EINJ even though it would probably be safe for them.  But we already
know those platforms are not really ACPI-compliant, so ...
