Hi, Bjorn,

Thank you for your comments and quick reply.

My thoughts exactly :)

Yes, there is always a window. But if we could do better in kernel that
reduces the window by 90% (from 33 seconds to 3 second), why not?

Yep, it is a hardware issue. The firmware only logs in console (ttyAMA0) and
we can not see it in kernel side. After the kernel starts seeing these error
reports, we could see EDAC/ghes and efi/cper detailed logs in dmesg. We did not
notice the problem until we check the console log, which inspired us to reduce
the window when kernel startup, so that we can see the message clearly and
properly. I think the intuition is to check the log of dmesg, not the console.

Haha, if the above reasons still don't convince you, I would like to accept yours :)
Should we do it in one patch or separate it into two patches?

If we explicit call ghes_init(), we can't tell if ghes is initialized
successfully based on the return value of initcall. So I add a info message.
What's your opinion, Rafeal?

Sorry, it's my wrong. I will fix it in next version.

I add it for future potential usage. Thank you for pointing it out.
If you think it is not necessary, I will delete it in next version.

Great idea. I will add a patch to rename them with "acpi_" prefix
