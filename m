I'm not really in favor of hiding the conditions under which _REG
calling is skipped in this way.

If you look at this RFC patch int introduces a EC_FLAGS_EC_REG_CALLED
flag in drivers/acpi/ec.c and then later on uses that flag to
determine that _REG still needs to be called when ec_install_handlers()
is called the second time when actually probing/parsing the ACPI EC
object.

If we hide the conditions under which _REG is skipped inside
ACPICA, then determining  when to call the new
acpi_execute_reg_methods() method is going to be somewhat tricky and
more over anyone reading the code then needs to also figure out that
acpica originally skipped this and under which conditions it was
orignally skipped.

IMHO having drivers/acpi/ec.c in full control over when to skip
(and thus also when to run _REG later) is cleaner then splitting
this over 2 different code bases.

Regards,

Hans
