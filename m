That might be a good solution.  I don't really want a situation where
leaving CONFIG_PCIEASPM unset is "known to break PME."

ASPM support has historically been fragile, and it's actually a
significant amount of code (~10KB on my x86), which is larger than
many other things for which we have config options.  But we do have
boot-time and run-time ways to disable it.

Another possibility might be to make it so Linux always advertises
ASPM support, but doesn't actually *do* anything unless
CONFIG_PCIEASPM is set.  I don't think advertising ASPM support means
the OS is required to change whatever configuration firmware did.
