Can we elaborate on this a little bit?  Referring to "known issues
with ACPI-based platforms" depends on a lot of domain-specific history
that most readers (including me) don't know.

I don't think "ACPI-based" or "devicetree-based" are good
justifications for changing the behavior because they don't identify
any specific reasons.  It's like saying "we can enable this feature
because the platform spec is written in French."

This is far too generic a statement for me to sign up to, especially
since "all Device Tree systems" doesn't say anything at all about how
any particular hardware works or what behavior we're relying on.

We need to say something about what D3hot means (i.e., only message
and type 0 config requests accepted) and that we know anything below
the bridge is inaccessible in D3hot and why that's OK.  E.g., maybe we
only care about wakeup requests and we know those still work with the
bridge in D3hot because XYZ.
