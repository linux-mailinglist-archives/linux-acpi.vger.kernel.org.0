If _S0W is not present, _S0D should return the deepest state that can be used.

If that is not present, it is a matter of OS policy.

Do you know what the rationale for that is?  Maybe Windows takes the
lack of _S0W/_S0D as the indication that the device could not go into
low-power states in D0, but do you actually know that this is the
case?

Surely, for non-bridge devices the lack of _S0W/_S0D does not mean
that the device should not be programmed into low-power states via
PMCSR, but maybe Root Ports are an exception?

And then who'll decide what to do with that return value?

I'm not sure that this is a core problem TBH.  It looks like this is
an exception made specifically for ports, so this check seems to
belong to where ports are handled, so that would be
acpi_pci_bridge_d3() after all.

However, _S0D needs to be checked too when _S0W is not present.
