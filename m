No, Xen parses the MADT directly from memory, before stating dom0.
That's a static table so it's fine for Xen to parse it and obtain the
I/O APIC GSI base.

Yes, Xen doesn't know the PCI device -> GSI mapping.  Dom0 needs to
parse the ACPI methods and signal Xen to configure a GSI with a
given trigger and polarity.

Yes, the hardware (native) I/O APIC is owned by Xen, and not directly
accessible by dom0.

I think that's always the case, as on dom0 devices to be passed
through are handled by pciback which does enable them.

I agree it might be best to not tie exposing the node to
pci_enable_device() having been called.  Is _PRT only evaluated as
part of acpi_pci_irq_enable()? (or pci_enable_device()).

We only support passthrough of PCI devices so far, but I guess if any
of such non-PCI devices ever appear and those use a GSI, and Xen
supports passthrough for them, then yes, we would need to fetch such
GSI somehow.

Thanks, Roger.
