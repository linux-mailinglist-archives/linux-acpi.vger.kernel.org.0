But the commit log says firmware scanned the bus (catching the
SErrors).  Shouldn't Linux be able to catch them the same way?

The "all-1s" response directly from hardware is typical of most
platforms, but I don't think it's strictly required by the PCIe spec
and I don't think it's absolutely essential even to Linux.  If you can
catch the SErrors, isn't there a way for software to fabricate that
all-1s data and continue after the read?

The main point is that *future* silicon should be designed to avoid
this issue.  I hope at least that part was not controversial.

If we want to take advantage of the generic PCI code supplied by
Linux, we have to expect that the hardware will play by the rules of
PCI.
