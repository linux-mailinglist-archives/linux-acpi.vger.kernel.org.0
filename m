I've had Generic Ports on my list to add to QEMU for a while but not been
high enough priority to either do it myself, or make it someone else's problem.
I suspect the biggest barrier in QEMU is going to be the interface to add
these to the NUMA description.

It's easy enough to hand build and inject a SRAT /SLIT/HMAT tables with
these in (that's how we developed the Generic Initiator support in Linux before
any BIOS support).  

So I'd like to see it soon, but I'm not hugely bothered if that element
follows this patch set. However, we are potentially going to see different
decisions made when that detail is added so it 'might' count as ABI
breakage if it's not there from the start. I think we are fine as probably
no BIOS' yet though.

I started typing no, then thought I'd just check.  Seems I did write support
for CDAT on switches (and then completely forgot about it ;)
It's upstream and everything!
