Hi Boris, Shiju,

Sorry for not spotting this reply earlier: Its in-reply to v1, so gets buried.

Its the 'else' catch-all for stuff drivers/acpi/apei  doesn't know to handle.

In this case its because its a vendor specific GUID that only the vendor driver knows how
to parse.

My thinking for this being needed was so user-space consumers of those tracepoints keep
working. Otherwise you upgrade, get this feature, and your user-space counters stop working.

You'd need to know this error source was now managed by an in-kernel driver, which may
report the errors somewhere else...

Move the drop to process context into ghes.c? This should result in less code.

I asked for this hooking to only be for the 'catch all' don't-know case so that we don't
get drivers trying to hook and handle memory errors. (if we ever wanted that, it should be
from part of memory_failure() so it catches all the ways of reporting memory-failure)
32bit arm has prior in this area.

As long as we don't walk a list of things that might handle a memory-error, and have some
random driver try and NOTIFY_STOP it....

aer_recover_queue() would be replaced by this. memory_failure_queue() has one additional
caller in drivers/ras/cec.c.


Thanks,
