It's bad also from another reason - the DT node was explicitly disabled,
but you perform some operation on actual hardware representing this
node. I would assume that a disabled DT node means it is not
operational, e.g. hardware not present or missing clocks, so you should
not treat it as another meaning - power down/unused.

I am not sure if I follow this. You have devices which
1. have unused ports, but all DT nodes are available/okay,
2. have unused ports, which are in DT status=disabled?

Doesn't case 2 break the bindings? If so, we don't care about such
out-of-tree users. We cannot support all of possible weird combinations
in out-of-tree DTS files...

I'll keep that argument for future when I see again patches adding such
wildcard compatible. :) I had to discuss with some folks...

Although the compatible difference does not have to be important here,
because one could say the 9662 and 9668 programming model is exaclty the
same and they differ by number of ports. This number of ports can be a
dedicated property or counted from the children (if they were all
available).

I propose this one. I would not care about out-of-tree DTSes which
decided to disable random stuff and expect things working. :)
