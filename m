I was thinking the pcie driver is for preserving the bus master bit on
the bridge. I just realized that the actual bus master bit preserve is
at the pci_dev level. The pcie driver call back is effectively no op.
Yes, I can delete those from the series and not save driver data at
all. Points taken.

Just to confirm my understanding aligned with you. We remove the
driver callbacks in PCI series until the vfio SR-IOV to add them back.

Oh, that is good then. I can still keep the PCI series as one incremental s=

Ack for removing driver callbacks in this series.
