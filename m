Not quite.

This seems to be intended for consumption by Linux booting in ACPI
mode, but not via UEFI, right? Some proposed changes to support that
were rejected on the basis that ACPI on non-x86 is strictly tied to
ACPI boot, not only because the ACPI root table (rsdp) can only be
discovered via UEFI, but also because the ACPI subsystem in Linux
cross-references any memory mappings created from AML code against the
UEFI memory map.

Unfortunately, having a vague, non-exhaustive approximation of the
UEFI memory map is unlikely to be sufficient here. The existing logic
assumes that addresses not covered by the UEFI memory map are MMIO,
which means that either a) the UEFI memory map needs to describe all
RAM exhaustively or b) the existing logic needs to be modified to take
memblock or other information sources into account as well in order to
reason about whether a certain address requires device or normal
memory attributes.

Note that the ACPI spec only lists EFI as a valid way to obtain the
root table pointer on architectures other than x86. If other ways are
needed, they should be contributed to the spec, rather than being
added to Linux as an ad hoc workaround for bootloaders that have
trouble implementing the spec as is.

Given the ACPI angle, promoting this to external ABI would introduce a
DT dependency to ACPI boot. So we'll at least have to be very clear
about which takes precedence, or maybe disregard everything except the
/chosen node when doing ACPI boot?

This also argues for not creating an ordinary binding for this (i.e.,
describing it as part of the platform topology), but putting it under
/chosen as a Linux-only boot tweak.

What I would prefer is to formalize pseudo-EFI boot and define the
bare required minimum (system table + memory map + config tables) in
an arch-agnostic manner. That way, the only thing that needs to be
passed via DT/boot_params/etc is the (pseudo-)EFI system table
address, and everything else (SMBIOS, ACPI as well as the EFI memory
map and even the initrd) can be passed via config tables as usual, all
of which is already supported in (mostly) generic kernel code.

This means that booting via the EFI stub would not be required, nor is
implementing boot services or runtime services or any of the other
things that people appear to hate with such a passion.

I'd actually prefer not to use those /chosen DT nodes, but pass the
memory map via a config table. This, however, requires* that the
runtime services memory regions are mapped 1:1 so it is not something
we can do for all currently supported systems. But for pseudo-EFI
boot, stipulating 1:1 runtime mappings is fine (or no runtime mappings
at all if the firmware does not expose runtime services)

* SetVirtualAddressMap() relocates the config table array, and without
a memory map, it is not possible to convert those address back to
physical. SetVirtualAddressMap() is evil and needs to die, but this is
off-topic for the thread at hand.
