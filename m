Yes I am familiar with that, and it is a completely different thing.

As i explained before, there is already prior art for this in
Tianocore, i.e., launching a Tianocore build based on a DT description
of the platform, including /memory and /reserved-memory nodes.

I argued that Tianocore never consumes memory reservations with UEFI
semantics, given that it supplants whatever UEFI functionality the
previous stage may have provided. But it shouldn't step on the code
and data regions used by the previous stage if it is still running in
the background (e.g., OS at EL1 and PSCI at EL2 on ARM)

So this brings me back to the things I proposed in my previous reply:
- memory reservations should be described in detail so the consumer
knows what to do with it
- memory reservations should have attributes that describe how the
memory may be used if not for the described purpose

I still don't see a reason for things like runtime-code and
runtime-data etc based on the above. If stage N describes the memory
it occupies itself as system memory, it should reserve it as well if
it needs to be preserved after stage N+1 has taken over, so perhaps it
should be described as a discardable memory reservation but I don't
think it necessarily needs a type in that case.
