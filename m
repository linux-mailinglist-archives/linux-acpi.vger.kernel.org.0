I do plan to apply this, but a little food for thought below.

I explored this issue a little bit with the ACPI/UEFI folks (see
https://members.uefi.org/wg/aswg/mail/thread/9265 if you have access).  

One aspect I had glossed over earlier is that on most recent machines,
the "E820 map" Linux uses is actually constructed internally by Linux
based on the UEFI memory map, and that construction conflates several
EFI types into E820_TYPE_RESERVED; see
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/x86-stub.c?id=v5.19#n576

We don't have a dmesg log with "efi=debug" for this case, but in most
cases where E820 says the entire root mem window is reserved, I think
it's because an EfiMemoryMappedIO entry was converted to
E820_TYPE_RESERVED.

From a response in the ACPI/UEFI discussion:

  The reason EfiMemoryMappedIO[1] exist in the UEFI memory map is to
  request a virtual mapping for UEFI Runtime Services.
  
  For example if the EFI Runtime Service needed to write to FLASH then
  the NOR FLASH would need a mapping. Also the NOR FLASH controller
  might also need a mapping and this could include PCI Config Space if
  needed registers existed in that space.
  
  Thus the EfiMemoryMappedIO entries just exist to pass up the
  EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME attribute in the UEFI Memory Map. This is the part
  of the contract for UEFI Runtime Service to use virtual mappings
  provided by the OS. So from an OS point of view EfiMemoryMappedIO has
  no other purpose.
  
  [1] UEFI: Table 7-5 Memory Type Usage before ExitBootServices() "Used
  by system firmware to request that a memory-mapped IO region be
  mapped by the OS to a virtual address so it can be accessed by EFI
  runtime services."

So the point here is that Linux currently converts EfiMemoryMappedIO
to E820_TYPE_RESERVED, and that likely attaches more meaning to those
regions than firmware intended.

I'm a little leery of changing that UEFI->E820 conversion because of
other possible implications, but it may be that omitting
EfiMemoryMappedIO entries from the E820 map and keeping the original
"avoid E820 regions" (4dc2287c1805) would also solve this problem.
