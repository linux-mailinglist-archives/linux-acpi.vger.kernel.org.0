To me, it seems better to do nothing unless a change would solve a
problem.  I raised it as a question to the PCI Firmware workgroup
(https://members.pcisig.com/wg/Firmware/mail/thread/32031), but I
haven't heard anything.

Regrettably, that link only works for PCI-SIG members; here's the text
of my question:

  Sorry to reopen this old topic.  This ECN was approved and appears
  in r3.3.  We're contemplating Linux changes to conform to it.

  I think I understand the ACPI requirement for OSPM to invoke _DSM
  Function 0 to learn whether a Function is supported (because a
  non-zero Function may have completely arbitrary return values, so
  invoking that Function has no way to return "this Function Index
  isn't supported").

  I don't understand why it's important for OSPM to "invoke all
  Functions other than Function 0 with the same Revision ID."  That
  idea doesn't appear in ACPI r6.5, sec 9.1.1 or in the sample ASL
  there.  Is there a benefit to using the same Revision ID for all
  Functions?  (Of course OSPM must invoke Function 0 with Revision ID
  N to learn whether Function X is supported for Revision ID N.)

  I also don't understand why "OSPM should successively invoke
  Function 0 with decremented values of Revision ID until system
  firmware returns a value indicating support for more than Function
  0."  ACPI r6.5 doesn't suggest that, and the sample ASL returns
  different bitmasks depending on the Revision ID supplied by OSPM,
  including a default case that returns a bitmask including all
  Functions implemented by the firmware if OSPM supplied a higher
  Revision ID from the future.  What is the benefit of probing with
  decremented Revision IDs?

  Is there something PCI-specific here, or should these requirements
  be in the ACPI spec instead of the PCI Firmware spec?

I'd prefer to wait until there are users of the new functions.
There's no real benefit to adding functions that are never called.
