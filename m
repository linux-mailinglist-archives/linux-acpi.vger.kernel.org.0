I know very well (but that's not a reason to break the PCIe
specification).

Still, the mistake you are making is thinking that ACPI compliancy
stops at the MCFG quirk. Adding another quirk to the MCFG list will make
PCI enumerates but there is more to that, eg MSI/IOMMU and that's
just an example.

There are platforms in that MCFG list that eg can't do MSI which
basically means they are useless - you look at it as yet another hook
into MCFG, I look at it with history in mind and from an ACPI ARM64
maintainership perspective.

So first thing to do is to post full support for this host controller
inclusive of MSI/INTx (which AFAICS is another piece of HW that is
not SBSA compliant since DWC uses a funnel to trigger MSIs) and
IOMMU, then we will see how to proceed.

Look at this (and again, that's just an example but AFAICS it applies to
this host bridge as well):

I am not discussing Linux patches at all - I am telling you that the
DWC host controller is not a) PCIe spec compliant b) SBSA compliant
and there is nothing to review from a Linux kernel code perspective.

This is just another quirk to enumerate with ACPI a non-compliant
system, if Bjorn is willing to take it go for it.

Don't you think I know ? I said "eventually" for a reason, read what

It is reality and it is not a *wish*, Nvidia will comply - even if
*eventually* we end up merging this code.

Why do you need ACPI support ? What for ?

I have a very high opinion of the upstream kernel and that's why
as I said above I think in terms of overall ACPI ARM64 maintainership
rather than a platform quirk to get ACPI PCI enumeration going.

See above, show us the rest of the story.

The issue is not very common at all. I said it before and I repeat it
again: those MCFG quirks were merged more than three years ago to help
bootstrap ACPI ARM64 ecosystem on early HW and ACPI for ARM64 is meant
for server (SBSA/SBBR compliant) systems, for other platforms DT is the
firmware of choice, ACPI on those does not work well (and *I* will have
to work around it).

I am not singling out anybody, read the mailing lists and you will
realize. You asked for this patch to be reviewed, I told you what
my thoughts are and this patch implications - you want to go ahead,
ask Bjorn to merge it but at least we do it with the broader
consequences in mind.
