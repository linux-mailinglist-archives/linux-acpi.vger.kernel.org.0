Right.

Yes, exactly. The some parts of the range 0x0d00-0xffff belongs to
PNP/ACPI so if we open the window now it might stomp over some crucial
ACPI resources.

Well, if firmware has configured the topology in such way I think we
should at least try to trust it is intentional. Even if the (PCIe)
device might have an I/O BAR it should work without it (only legacy
endpoints are allowed to create I/O requests, althought many non-legacy
seem to include I/O BAR).
