The probe status quickly returns ENODEV. Based on the output (we don't log
much, so this is just an educated guesss), I think that means the driver read
all F's from the status register, which indicates we can't read it when using
the reassigned memory window.

Why changing memory windows may not work tends to be platform or device
specific. Considering the renumbered windows didn't cause a problem for other
devices, it sounds like this nvme device may be broken.
