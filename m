Is that defined anywhere? The generic MSI binding just has some weaselly 
wording about buses:

"When #msi-cells is non-zero, busses with an msi-parent will require 
additional properties to describe the relationship between devices on 
the bus and the set of MSIs they can potentially generate."

which appears at odds with its own definition of msi-parent as including 
an msi-specifier (or at best very unclear about what value that 
specifier should take in this case).

The PCI MSI binding goes even further and specifically reserves 
msi-parent for cases where there is no sideband data. As far as I'm 
aware, the fact that the ITS driver implements a bodge for the "empty 
msi-parent even though #msi-cells > 0" case is merely a compatibility 
thing for old DTs from before this was really thought through, not an 
officially-specified behaviour.
