sure. it's up to you. thanks.

Thanks for the illustration. I can understand what DT does as it's defined
clearly in [1]. The CPUs in the system may have different capacity-dmips-mhz
as well as frequency so we first obtain the DMIPS/MHz and then scaled it with
the max frequency.

Seems we have different meaning of raw capacity on DT based and ACPI based system.
On DT based system it doesn't consider the max frequency of each CPU so we need
to take the frequency into account later. But on ACPI based system the max perf
has already take the max frequency into account and we don't need to consider
the frequency differences among the CPUs. If so, the comment [2] is no more
correct as we don't need to scale the capcity according to the frequnecy but
not because that we cannot get the raw cpu capacity on ACPI based system.

The CPUs on ACPI based system may also have different DMIPS and maximum frequency,
the same with the DT based system. Is it possible to keep consistence with
what DT does? As defined by the spec[3], the CPPC aims to "maintaining a performance
definition that backs a continuous, abstract, unit-less performance scale" and
"leaves the definition of the exact performance metric to the platform." So is it
possible we can also interpret it as "capacity-dmips-mhz"? Then to scale the cpu
with max frequency provided by cpufreq, for example cppc_cpufreq. I'm not sure I'm
right and understand it correctly, please correct me if I'm wrong.

For this series, the arm64 part works and based on 5.17-rc7 I tested this on qemu
with modified DSDT:

estuary:/$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/acpi_cppc/highest_perf
10000
10000
10000
10000
5000
5000
5000
5000
estuary:/$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpu_capacity
1024
1024
1024
1024
512
512
512
512

If needed
