Ah, got it. That means the PCI ECAM has a implicit mutual exclusion with EINJ
if the hardware implemention is correct, so we can remove the MCFG from
the APEI's safely.

As a summary: we need to reserve the MCFG areas on those platforms with a
quirk ECAM implementation since there's no lockless method to access the
configuration space, on other platforms we don't need to reserve the MCFG
resources (so can remove it safely).

So we need to add another patch to handle the case of tegra194 and xgene...
I will try to figure it out.
