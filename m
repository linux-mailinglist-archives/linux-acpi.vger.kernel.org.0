I don't think this should be any surprise, but this patch on top of your 
series fixes the issue on that system.

And from what I can tell this *does* make a "reservation".
Specifically because pci_mmcfg_late_insert_resources() uses 
insert_resource() to put it in place.  I would expect if something else 
tries to request that region later it would get a conflict.
