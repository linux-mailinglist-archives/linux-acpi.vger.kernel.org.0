IMV, the first PCIe Non-Bridge Endpoint Function 0 driver approach
would be sort of fragile and cumbersome to enforce.

First come, first serve is much simpler and should be sufficient for now AF=
AICS.

Say two drivers request the Aux power from the same Root Port and each
of them passes a limit sufficient for its device.  Without
aggregation, what guarantees that the last limit passed will be
sufficient for both devices?

Also see the spec provision regarding retries below.

This means that the platform firmware is supposed to do its own
aggregation, but at the system (board) level, not at the Root Port
level.

The algorithm is described above and my understanding of it is that
once a request has been granted, it cannot be retracted later.  Also
it appears to assume a 1:1 correspondence between PCIe slots and Root
Ports.

The guys who haven't been granted their requests at once may be asked
to try again later and there may not be enough Aux power for the last
guys at all, so they will not get it and they will stay on the main
power.  And again, this appears to be at the Root Port granularity.
