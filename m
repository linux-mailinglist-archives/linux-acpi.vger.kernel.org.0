I'd say let's do this in typical Linux fashion and not solve future
problems before they need to be solved. I.e. start small and build
incrementally. To me that looks like a sysfs interface to convey a
cached copy of a CDAT with an internal interface for a driver to
trigger invalidations and re-reads on the next access. This would
assume that userspace may have left the DOE in an indeterminate state
and an abort cycle may be needed. A 1 second delay for the rare case
where a collision is detected seems reasonable for just CDAT
retrieval.
