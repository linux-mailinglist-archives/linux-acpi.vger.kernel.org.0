The reporter of 2302253 has reported that the patches from:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm.git/log/?h=acpi-ec-fixes

resolve the issue; and as mentioned before the reporter of 2298938
is not responsive atm. So I believe that with it confirmed that this
at least fixes the issues on the LG Gram laptops (1) these patches are
ready to be merged now.

Regards,

Hans



1) And based on dmesg with a regressed kernel likely / hopefully also
the issue from RH bugzilla 2298938.
