Right, that's the check I was referring to.  But I'm afraid there is
no explicit rule in Thunderbolt / USB4 specs that hotplug ports must
be runtime suspended in order to save power, at least to the best
of my knowledge.

In practice, Thunderbolt controllers come in one of two forms,
discrete or integrated into the CPU.  Originally only discrete
controllers existed, but over time it became more and more common
to integrate them.

Apple was pretty much the only vendor which sold larger quantities
of Thunderbolt 1 and 2 chips in the 2010 to 2016 era.  Back in the day,
only discrete controllers existed and they consumed around 1.5 to 2 W.
On laptops, that's a significant amount of energy, so from day 1, Apple
put load switches on their motherboards which allowed the Thunderbolt
controllers to be powered down if nothing is plugged in.

With the *integrated* Thunderbolt controllers, powering down on idle
is usually likewise required to allow the entire CPU package to enter
a low power state.

To the operating system, a Thunderbolt controller is visible as a
PCIe switch with an NHI device below one of the Downstream Ports
and hotplugged devices appearing below the other Downstream Ports.
The NHI is a vendor-agnostic Native Host Interface for tunnel setup,
similar to the OHCI, EHCI, XHCI interface definitions that are in use
with USB and FireWire controllers.

Linux uses a hierarchical power management model, i.e. parent devices
cannot runtime suspend unless their children runtime suspend.  Thus,
the hotplug ports need to runtime suspend and then the Switch Upstream
Port can runtime suspend and that triggers powerdown of the controller.

To cut a long story short, in *practice* Thunderbolt hotplug ports need
to be put into D3hot in order to save power, so that's what we do.
And we know from experience that they're all *safe* to be put into D3hot.
Hence we're whitelisting them in pci_bridge_d3_possible().

By contrast, I recall that we got MCEs on Xeon-SP processors back in
the day when their Root Ports were put into D3hot.  Hence the rather
conservative approach taken in pci_bridge_d3_possible() to whitelist
only known-good, newer hardware.

So I've just looked through the PCI Firmware Spec and can't find that
mentioned anywhere explicitly, but it's pretty obvious if you think
about it:

If the OS puts the hotplug port in D3hot, its downstream bus transitions
to either B2 or B3 (PCI Power Management Spec r1.2 sec 4.7.1).

Which means devices downstream of the hotplug port become inaccessible.
If hotplug control wasn't granted to the OS, firmware expects it may
handle the hotplug port without interference by the OS.

If the OS fiddles with the hotplug port's power state, that expectation
is no longer met.  Let's say the firmware reads the downstream device's
Vendor ID register to probe whether the device is there.  That'll no
longer work as expected once the hotplug port is transitioned to D3hot
by the operating system.

In retrospect, this code comment is probably confusing:

		/*
		 * Hotplug ports handled by firmware in System Management Mode
		 * may not be put into D3 by the OS (Thunderbolt on non-Macs).
		 */
		if (bridge->is_hotplug_bridge && !pciehp_is_native(bridge))
			return false;

This is not in any way specific to Thunderbolt.  It's just that
back in the day, Thunderbolt tunnel management was done natively
on Macs, whereas non-Macs did it in firmware.  That has since
changed and most vendors have adopted native tunnel management.
So the code comment is outdated.  The following would probably
be more accurate today:

		/*
		 * Hotplug ports handled by firmware in System Management Mode
		 * may not be put into D3 by the OS (behind firmware's back).
		 */

Right on all accounts.  Those invocations of pci_bridge_d3_possible()
are all in code paths which run only once, e.g. on enumeration and removal
of the PCIe port and on shutdown.  We figured that it's not worth it
to cache the return value of pci_bridge_d3_possible() for these few
invocations, none of which are in hot paths.  ("We" is mostly Mika and
yours truly, who introduced this for Thunderbolt power management.)
