After seeing the options, I think I'd prefer to not have to worry what
extra magic is happening with cxl_read_mbox_reg32()

cxl_read_mbox_reg32(cxlm, CXLDEV_MB_CAPS_OFFSET);

readl(cxlm->mbox_regs + CXLDEV_MB_CAPS_OFFSET);

The latter is both shorter and more idiomatic.

That seems like too many lines.

/* CXL 2.0 8.2.8.4.3 Mailbox Capabilities Register */

...this looks ok.
