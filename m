Cool series, thanks for doing that!

You may add my
Revieweed-by: Andy Shevchenko <andriy.shevchenko@linux.intel.com>
to all non-commented, by me, patches (excluding soundwire) and to ones
where comment just about one line/two lines split (address them if you
are okay, otherwise ignore those comments).
