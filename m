In all honesty, I really wonder why we are even having this discussion:

- The HW is unavailable to the mere mortal. And even most superheroes
   cannot get their hands on it

- Even with this terrible son of a hack, essential PCIe features cannot
   work (and yes, I do consider SR-IOV as an essential feature)

- If we take this hack and somehow get this thing to run with mainline,
   we will never be able to say "no" to this kind of unfinished,
   *prototype* implementations ever again

To sum it up: a hack that doesn't really work for a prototype that you
can't really buy? Why should we even care?
