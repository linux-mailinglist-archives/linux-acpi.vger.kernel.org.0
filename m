So you could then still call pci_d3cold_disable() from the XHCI driver on only those controllers.

If both the USB adapter and the parent port are in D3hot, the link
should stay up, shouldn't it?  It should go to L1 (if enabled), but
still be usable for wake interrupts.  I'm looking at PCIe r6.0, sec
5.2, Table 5-1.
