Nor did the quirk following that email, which was merged. Presumably 
because I'm not sure anyone can predict the future, and some of the 
points in that posting were made simply to fill gaps in the arguments 
around why the SMC is/was a better plan. The final point about requiring 
a MCFG is also flies in the face of the fact that there is an Arm/Pci 
Standardized way to deal with these problems which is supported by other 
OS's running on these platforms and it requires that MFCG is missing. 
The idea that MCFG will magically appear for only Linux and contain 
relevant info (like the non even power of two cfg region on this SoC) is 
a bit wishful.

I'm certainly in no place to claim future PCIe compliance for Broadcom's 
SoC's, nor its lifecycle. I'm betting few people submitting Linux 
patches are, particularly for mostly community supported projects like 
the RPi4/CM4/ACPI port. I'm more than happy to hack/tweak future 
problems with this code, and possibly even extend it if needed. Thats 
about the extent of what I can do.


Thanks,
