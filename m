Following up on the PCI BAR0 reset issue, I have collected more data
and performed additional debugging steps. Below are the key
observations and queries:

Observations:
1. The issue occurs randomly after a few days of system uptime.
2. When the issue occurs, reading the PCI configuration space (lspci
-xxx -s 01:00.0) sometimes returns all 0xffs from offset 0x00 to 0x3F
or the entire config space.
$ sudo lspci -xxx -s 01:00.0
01:00.0 RAM memory: PLDA Device 5555 (rev ff)
00: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff
10: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff
20: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff
30: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff

e0: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff
f0: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff

$ uptime
 11:29:59 up 3 days, 14:39,  1 user,  load average: 0.75, 0.57, 0.47

3. After this, subsequent reads restore non-0xff values, but BAR0 gets
reset to zero.

Debugging Steps Taken:
Used ftrace to track relevant PCI, hotplug, and BIOS-related function calls=
:

echo function > current_tracer
echo '*pci* *hotplug* *bios*' > set_ftrace_filter

Captured a 19MB trace file, so sharing the full trace isn't feasible.

few lines of the dmesg log, where it returned "all ones" from config
space is mentioned below:

Questions & Next Steps:
1. Device Inaccessibility:
When reading all 0xffs from config space, does this indicate the
device is reset or powered down?
Shouldn't the kernel receive a hotplug event or error notification in this =
case?

2. ftrace Analysis:
Are there any additional function filters I should apply to
set_ftrace_filter to capture relevant events?
Any specific function calls in the trace file that I should focus on
for debugging?

Any recommended PCIe registers to check?
Let me know your thoughts and any additional suggestions.
