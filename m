Right, the design of the feature would be completely different if it 
were a simple register read to get the delivered perf avoiding all the 
jumping around you quoted.

Which sorta implies that its not really fixable as is, which IMHO means 
that 'n' isn't really strong enough, it should probably be under 
CONFIG_EXPERT as well if such a change were made to discourage its use.
