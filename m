Hi Dan,

Got it. Writing userspace to code with arbitrary kernel
breakage of exchanges userspace initialized is going to be nasty.

It's that 'validate the state of the DOE' which is the problem.  I 'think'
the only way to do that is to issue an abort every time and I'm really
not liking the fact that adds a potential 1 second sleep to every
DOE access from the kernel.  There is no other way of knowing there is
no exchange already in flight that might come back and bite you even
after you think you have a clean state + I think you might be able to
construct cases where even inspecting the data isn't enough to tell.
If we are safe with today's protocols, there is no guarantee we will be
in future. If the DOE design had incorporated such a flag or counter of
exchanges in flight, then this might have been a workable approach.

I agree with a cooperation scheme, but I think that should take the
form of a proper interface rather than a one sided lock out.
It may well make sense to tighten access to PCI config space anyway but
I think that's a discussion that should be separate from this feature.

This last suggestion makes sense to me. Let's provide a 'right' way
to access the DOE from user space. I like the idea if it being possible
to run CXL compliance tests from userspace whilst the driver is loaded.

Bjorn, given this would be a generic PCI thing, any preference for what
this interface might look like?   /dev/pcidoe[xxxxxx].i with ioctls similar
to those for the BAR based CXL mailboxes?

Thanks,

Jonathan
