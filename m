Seriously? You want to go down the road again of poisoning the
atmosphere here, and blaming everyone else for doing it? I had enough
of that with the Zinc debacle, and I thought we had moved beyond that,
after having collaborated constructively with you on various topics
over the past couple of years.

Please stop with the ad hominems in response to criticism on factual
aspects of your code. Putting someone else's authorship on code they
did not write is not cool, and pointing that out is *not* what is
making this space unpleasant.
And 'paperwork policing' is sadly an important aspect of a high
profile open source project such as Linux.

When you ask for my review, you get my review. If there are aspects of
your contributions that are a priori exempt from criticism, I think
you're in the wrong place.

If you did not check the rodata/data/bss sizes of all modules
depending on this macro, or checked their memory usage at runtime, you
cannot definitively say that nothing has changed.

*However*, as I argued below, using ACPI_ID_LEN to allocate a string
that needs to hold a HID or CID provided by the ACPI subsystem might
well result in a buffer overrun, as the ACPI subsystem will happily
return longer strings.

So my conclusion is that the change is ok, which is why I gave my reviewed-by.
