If you only want to use ACPI APEI and you never need native AER
support, you may not need an RCEC.  But note that an RCEC *is*
required if you want PME messages or Function Readiness Status (FRS)
for RCiEPs.

I don't know much about IORT, but it's not the way we discover these
devices.

RCiEPs and RCECs should be discovered the same way as Root Ports: a
PNP0A03 device in the ACPI namespace describes a PCI host bridge, and
the _CRS method of that PNP0A03 device contains a bus number range.
The base of that range is the root "bus" on which Root Ports, RCiEPs,
RCECs, and possibly some Conventional PCI devices exist.

The machine Jonathan mentioned above should have 12 PNP0A03 devices,
one for each of the root buses he listed.

RCiEPs and RCECs are type 0 devices, so they're not bridges.  They
have no secondary bus.
