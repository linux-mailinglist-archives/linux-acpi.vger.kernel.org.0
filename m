I co-maintain OVMF [including the ARM port that I created from
scratch] as well as the ARM architecture support in Tianocore, along
with a couple of platform ports for ARM boards, some of which could by
now be characterized as 'historical' (AMD Seattle, Socionext SynQuacer
and Raspberry Pi 3/4). So I think I have a pretty good handle on how
Tianocore based firmware is put together.

Tianocore as a payload will expose boot services to the OS, and will
provide the OS with a memory map using the UEFI APIs. But you still
haven't explained why the memory description this Tianocore inherits
from the Platform Init would include any UEFI boot or runtime service
regions, or any of the other memory regions with UEFI semantics.
TIanocore just needs to know a) where memory lives b) which parts of
it are already in use (as far as the memory map is concerned), and the
existing bindings suffice for this purpose.

In short, the memory regions with UEFI semantics are created by the
boot phase that actually exposes UEFI to the OS, in which case the
boot services can be used to obtain the memory map. If the consumer is
not UEFI based, there is no reason to bother it with descriptions of
memory regions that have no significance to it.

That part is clear to me.

I suppose you are referring to the proprietary FSP components? Those
are mostly made up of PEIMs (in Tianocore/EDK2 speak) for DDR training
and chipset initialization, and don't really take part in the
implementation of the UEFI APIs. Strictly, they are not 'chunks of
UEFI' but 'chunks of PI' (but even Tianocore itself, being the
reference implementation of both UEFI and PI, does a terrible job at
distinguishing between the two)
