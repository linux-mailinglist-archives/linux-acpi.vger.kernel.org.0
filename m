Hi Saravana,

Thank you for working on this !

I gave it a try, rebasing my branch from v5.9 to v5.10-rc2 first. On
v5.10-rc2 the kernel dies when booting due to a deadlock (reported by
lockdep, so hopefully not too hard to debug). *sigh*. Fortunately, it
dies after the fw_devlink initialization, so I can still report results.

Before your series:

[    0.743065] cpuidle: using governor menu
[   13.350259] No ATAGs?

With your series applied:

[    0.722670] cpuidle: using governor menu
[    1.135859] No ATAGs?

That's a very clear improvement :-)
