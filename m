The problem is that from a PCIe point of view, UR is something we
should be able to tolerate.  It happens during enumeration and also
during hotplug.  It definitely does not mean "the system is screwed up
and must be rebooted."

To go back to Figure 6-3, I'm getting the impression that the "System
Error" shown at the top is *not* the "SError" you're referring to.  If
they were the same, the Root Control enable bits should gate it, but
according to your lspci, those enable bits are cleared, yet you still
take SErrors.

SError is asynchronous and imprecise.  Is there no way to do the
config access in a way that makes it precise, by adding some kind of
sync?  There's no reason we can't single-thread config accesses and
maybe even MMIO/IO port accesses as well if necessary.
