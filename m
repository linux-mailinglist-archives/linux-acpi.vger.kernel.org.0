Thank you for explaining! It is a lot more clear now :-)

I have separated out the PCI portions of this patchset (patches 1-4
i.e. ones not related to this controversial change) into its own
patchset. W.r.t patches 5-7, I think I'd like to collect my thoughts
and send out a fresh RFC once I am ready (I'm running out of time on
my deliverables so may have to carry some patches internally for the
time being). But 2 quick points:

1) Currently there are already at least 2 existing buses with their
own versions of "authorized": usb and thunderbolt, and the UAPI /
semantics of "authorized" is different amongst these.

Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-thunderbolt - "authorized" is boolean
Documentation/usb/authorization.rst  - "authorized" is 0/1/2

(Side note: In addition to that, usb also has additional "authorized"
related attributes e.g. interface_authorized_default etc which might
not have an easy corresponding sensible meaning in other buses, so we
may have to still leave it in USB.)

So my question is, assuming we do not want to change or break existing
UAPI, if I move the "authorized" attribute to the device core, who
defines the semantics of the values it can take? It seems to me like
individual buses should define that. And if so, then device core
cannot use "authorized" value to decide to prevent drivers from
binding to it?

2) It seemed to me
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-acpi/20200618184621.GA446639@kroah.com/)
that we had at least somewhat agreement that the location of a device
is a useful piece of info to have for userspace to have. The point I'm
trying to make is that "exporting the location of device in sysfs"
seems independent of "move untrusted attribute to the device core".
LIke you said below, location of device is still useful (may not be
sufficient, BMC case you mention) for the userspace to have, in order
to decide whether to allow a device.  So why object to this patch?

Thanks,

Rajat
