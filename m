Yes, I agree it makes sense to combine with set_pcie_untrusted(). I
can do that in the next iteration of my patch, that I intend to work
on after we reach some sort of conclusion on the other major comments
below.

The pci_dev->untrusted property is currently used by:

- IOMMU drivers to determine whether bounce buffers should be used,
and whether flush queue should be used for these devices.
- PCI subsystem to determine ACS settings (ATS / TB etc)

As we can see from the usage above, the current primary use of
untrusted property in the kernel is to flag and protect against
devices that can create a DMA attack on the host physical memory
address space (also documented for these properties in [1][2]). IMHO,
this property belongs to PCI devices because:
 * I do not know of any other bus (other than PCI) that can allow DMA
access of the host memory, to a device on that bus.
 * There is some use of this property within the PCI (see above),
although I agree it is not much.
 * The existing properties are currently documented [1][2] to be part
of PCIe root ports / PCI-PCI bridges (only):

[1] https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/pci/dsd-for-pcie-root-ports
[2] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/pci.txt

One can possibly read the device properties in IOMMU drivers, but
they'd need to keep it in some device structure. I understand moving
the pci_dev->untrusted into struct device has been brought up a couple
of times in the past, and has met with much stronger resistance. The
discussion turned into a discussion on security, and the semantics of
this property, and allowing userspace to change this property etc,
requiring major changes, and thus fizzled out of motivation.

I'd like to mention that I'm not proposing any changes to the way
(already existing) pci_dev->untrusted is being used, or the semantics
of this flag. I'm only trying to solve a corner case here i.e.
internal devices don't have a way to specify this attribute. Thus
requiring us (Chromeos) to carry hacks like [3]. I believe there are
others who are also looking for this corner case. From [4]:

==============================
We have a similar trust issue with the BMC in servers even
though they're internal devices. They're typically network accessible
and infrequently updated so treating them as trustworthy isn't a great
idea. We have been slowly de-privileging the BMC over the last few
years, but the PCIe interface isn't locked down enough for my liking
since the SoCs we use do allow software to set the VDID and perform
arbitrary DMAs (thankfully limited to 32bit). If we're going to add in
infrastructure for handling possibly untrustworthy PCI devices then
I'd like to use that for BMCs too.
=============================

[3] https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/third_party/kernel/+/3171209
[4] https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/6/9/1467

So from what I see, there is a need to solve this problem for internal
PCI devices. And presently what I have, seemed like the path of least
resistance to me (i.e. without running into big discussions, and major
code changes).

I'd greatly appreciate if you could please consider the information I
presented above, and suggest an approach that you think is more
acceptable.

Thanks & Best Regards,

Rajat
