Thank you Pierre for the test results. I have been also told about some
platform under stress-test having cppc_fie kthread "up to 50% CPU
utilization". I don't know how many additional wake-ups they would see.

We also don't know if the tasks utilization thanks to that feature on
these machine is noticeable better (or if it was an issue at the
begging).

These numbers are not acceptable on a server.
