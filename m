Have you looked at the log of the failed boot in the Steam Deck kernel
bugzilla? Everything there seems to work just fine and then the system
just hangs. I think that maybe it cannot find its root disk, so maybe
an NVME issue ?

I'm afraid that if we cannot figure out the exact root cause from
the failed boot log there is not much more we can do. Unless you
have an idea how to debug this further and want to ask the reporter
for more info?

Regards,

Hans
