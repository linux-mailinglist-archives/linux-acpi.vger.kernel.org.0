Think about all these again.  Finally I admit you are right.  The
general interface is better mainly if there are multiple implementations
of the interface.

In this series, we provide just one implementation: HMAT.  And, the
second one: CDAT will be implemented soon.  And, CDAT will use the same
method to translate from read/write bandwidth/latency to adistance.  So,
I suggest to:

- Keep the general interface (and notifier chain), for HMAT and soon
  available CDAT

- Move the code to translate from read/write bandwidth/latency to
  adistance to memory-tiers.c.  Which is used by HMAT now and will be
  used by CDAT soon.  And it can be used by other drivers.

What do you think about that?
