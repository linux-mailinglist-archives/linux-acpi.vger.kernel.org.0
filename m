No, this is not fully correct. The drivers anyway have to adopted for
the platforms they are used with. It is perfectly fine to have a driver
that supports both DT and ACPI at the same time.

I don't think upstream developers care about the downstream kernels.

But let me throw an argument why this patch (or something similar) looks
to be necessary.

Both on DT and non-DT systems the kernel allows using the non-OF based
matching. For the platform devices there is platform_device_id-based
matching.

Currently handling the data coming from such device_ids requires using
special bits of code, e.g. platform_get_device_id(pdev)->driver_data to
get the data from the platform_device_id. Having such codepaths goes
against the goal of unifying DT and non-DT paths via generic property /
fwnode code.

As such, I support Sui's idea of being able to use device_get_match_data
for non-DT, non-ACPI platform devices.

Sui, if that fits your purpose, please make sure that with your patch
(or the next iteration of it) you can get driver_data from the matched
platform_device_id.

This doesn't constitute a fix. It's not that there is a bug that you are
fixing. You are adding new feature ('support for non-DT platforms').

The implementation is still incorrect. The swnode code shouldn't look
into the OF data. Please use non-DT match IDs.
