Apparently you're referring to the Physical Slot Number in the Slot
Capabilities register of a VMD Root Port?  That would not be related
to the NVMe device or whatever is *connected* to that Root Port.  It's
important to use the specific names to understand what's happening
here.

IIUC this path registers the slot with a slot number from the ACPI
_SUN method (register_slot() calls check_slot() to evaluate _SUN).

IIUC this path registers the slot with a slot number from
PCI_EXP_SLTCAP_PSN (see init_slot() in pciehp).

Why do we care about hotplug?  I don't think the Physical Slot Number
depends on hotplug support.

But it does look like we don't look at PCI_EXP_SLTCAP_PSN except in
pciehp, so if a slot doesn't support hotplug, I guess we probably
don't expose the slot in /sys/bus/pci/slots/.  I dunno whether that's
the right thing or not.

I can see that it might be useful to know what physical slot a device
is in even if the slot doesn't support hotplug.  And it seems that's
what you want to do here?  You want to expose the "slot" number of a
particular M.2 connector, even though the socket doesn't support
hotplug?

Capitalize them so we know they refer specifically to things in the
PCIe spec.

So it seems like the question is whether we want to expose the slot
number in *general* (not just for M.2, U.2, etc) even when the slot
does not support hotplug.  The same would apply to normal PCIe slots
in a server or desktop, where you would put a GPU, NIC, etc, etc.

M.2 is a form factor specification that really doesn't have anything
to do with the enumeration and configuration done by software.  As far
as I can tell, there's nothing special about M.2 that justifies this
patch, so while M.2 might be an *example* of a case where this is
useful, it's not the *reason* for making a change like this.

This patch basically reads the Physical Slot Number in the Slot
Capabilities register in a case where we didn't previously do that.

I guess we're reading PCI_EXP_SLTCAP from a VMD Root Port?  And we
currently don't do that for some reason?  I assume the same exact
problem would occur if that VMD Root Port were connected to an
ordinary PCIe slot?
