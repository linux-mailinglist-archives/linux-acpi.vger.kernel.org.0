The specification is capable of representing all the actual physical 
topologies I'm aware of, its also capable of representing quite a number 
of topologies that don't make sense to (cant be) build and are largely 
nonsense. There are some further details around replacement and 
allocation which could be represented but were AFAIK not considered 
worth the effort because it makes the representation far more complex.

So, except for minor clarifications I'm not aware of a need to update it.

I understood this was for RISC-V when I reviewed it, but i'm fairly 
certain the general cache topologies of RISC-V machines don't vary in 
their core concepts and layout much from the wide variety of 
possibilities available elsewhere. So its roughly the same problem, you 
will likely have one or two layers of split I/D caches and then a number 
of unified private or shared caches above that.

I don't think "fully trust" is something you really want, or is helpful 
as I suggested above.

I suspect all that is needed is the construction of the missing I/D 
layers, as the existing code will create the Unified layers above as it 
does today. On Arm64 the unified system level caches aren't usually 
described by the core cache registers either, which is why there is that 
existing bit of code to change unknown caches to unified. But it also 
turns out the pptt walking code is capable of providing the information 
to create the I/D layers as well, if they are matched (ex there exists 
an I cache for every D cache at a certain level).

So, more clarity about the kinds of topologies you expect is helpful to 
understand where the current code is failing.

AKA, As I mentioned I'm fairly certain that its possible to construct 
the entire cache topology from the PPTT by changing get_cache_type() to 
return "CACHE_TYPE_SEPERATE" when the level is less than the value 
returned as "split_level" from acpi_get_cache_info(). That tends to 
ignore some edge cases, but I might put them in the "don't to that" bucket.

If so, can you describe the edge case you care about that isn't solved 
with a change like that?
