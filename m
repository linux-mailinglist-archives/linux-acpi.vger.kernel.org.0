IIRC ACPICA will simply run the method with the assumption that the
AML in there will deal with the arguments properly anyway.

I can agree that printing these warnings on a user system by default
is not very useful, at least as long as no visible functional issues
are present, but if there are such issues, it is good to know that
something fishy is going on.  For instance, while the method may
execute successfully, the result of that may not be as expected.

So maybe they should be debug level or similar.

As par the above, no workarounds should be needed, but I'll let Bob
and Erik (CCed now) confirm or deny this.

A side note: please CC all discussions regarding general ACPI issues
to linux-acpi, so they can get the attention of all of the right
people (who may not subscribe linux-pci, for example).
