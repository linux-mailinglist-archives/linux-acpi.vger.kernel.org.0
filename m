I poked around in the old specs and found that _HPX was added in ACPI
r3.0, where the Type 2 record only contained AER registers
(Uncorrectable Error Mask, Uncorrectable Error Severity, and
Correctable Error Mask), and the description said this:

  OSPM will only evaluate _HPX with Setting Record – Type 2 if OSPM is
  not controlling the PCI Express Advanced Error Reporting capability.

ACPI r4.0 changed _HPX to the current r6.6 description and added all
the registers included in r6.6 (without changing the record revision).

So I think we should do what I proposed above (only do
program_hpx_type2() if the OS owns PCIe hotplug but not AER, and only
update the CERE/NFERE/FERE/URRE bits in Device Control).  I would
probably log the Link Control values if they're set, but otherwise
ignore them.
