Further down in the review..

The fact that you end up bypassing the payload transfer stuff in mbox_cmd
rather suggests it's not a particularly good model.  + it keeps confusing
me.

While the hardware uses a single region for the payload, there is nothing
saying the code has to work that way.   Why not have separate payload_in and
payload_out pointers?  Occasionally you might set them to the same buffer, but
elsewhere you could avoid the direct memcpy()s you are doing around the
send_cmd().
