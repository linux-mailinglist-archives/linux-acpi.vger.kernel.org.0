Thanks a lot for the thorough explanation. I will give that a try on
x86, I assume the ACPI tables also built to match these cmdline options.

If iommu_domain is shared by multiple device from different NUMA node,
I guess taking the first one is as good as anyone. It would not be
an optimal configuration.

I think it is a safe assumption.

I agree, guest should always allocate DMA and IOVA page tables basedon
the endpoint. VT-d currently allocates page table pages based on IOMMU
NUMA node, that might have to change.
