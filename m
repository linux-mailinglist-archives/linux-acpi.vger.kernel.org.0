This file belongs to ACPICA.  As a general rule, ACPICA changes should
be submitted as pull requests to the upstream ACPICA project on
GitHub, from where they are backported (semi-automatically) to Linux.

However, if an upstream ACPICA pull request has been submitted, a
corresponding Linux patch can be posted with a Link: tag pointing to
that pull request.

Thanks!
