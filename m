Sounds like you're using "PCIe topology extension" to mean
specifically something below a Thunderbolt controller, excluding a
subtree below a root port.  I don't think the PCI core is aware of
that distinction.

The SoC is a physical packaging issue that really doesn't enter into
the specs directly.  I'm trying to get at the logical topology
questions in terms of the PCIe and ACPI specs.

I assume we could dream up a non-Thunderbolt topology that would show
the same problem?

I'm not very familiar with _PR3.  I guess this is under an ACPI object
representing a PCI device, e.g., \_SB.PCI0.RP0._PR3?

So in this example we might have:

  _SB.PCI0.RP0._PR3: TBT
  _SB.PCI0.RP1._PR3: TBT
  _SB.PCI0.NHI._PR3: TBT

And when Linux figures out that everything depending on TBT is in
D3hot, it evaluates TBT._OFF, which puts them all in D3cold?  And part
of the problem is that they're now in D3cold (where config access
doesn't work) but Linux still thinks they're in D3hot (where config
access would work)?

I feel like I'm missing something because I don't know how D3C is
involved, since you didn't mention suspending xHCI.

And I can't mentally match up the patch with the D3hot/D3cold state
change (if indeed that's the problem).  If we were updating the path
that evaluates _OFF so it changed the power state of all dependent
devices, *that* would make a lot of sense to me because it sounds like
that's where the physical change happens that makes things out of
sync.
