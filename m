4. It seems that all devices which have issues with allocating
a PCI bar are Ice Lake based; and the model where the ignoring
of e820 reservations has been reported to cause issues is somewhat
old. It is a Haswell, but still getting BIOS updates causing
the BIOS date check to enable the new behavior. So another
solution might be to only ignore e820 reservations on machines
with Intel Ice Lake (and presumably also Tiger Lake) CPUs.


5. It also seems that the troublesome e820 entry on all devices
ends at 0xcfffffff and starts well below 0x8000000 :

Yoga C940:
[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x000000004bc50000-0x00000000cfffffff] reserved

IdeaPad 3 15IIL05:
[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x000000004bc50000-0x00000000cfffffff] reserved

Lenovo IdeaPad 5 14IIL05:
[    0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x000000005bc50000-0x00000000cfffffff] reserved


Actually even the lower addresses seem to follow a pattern.

So I guess that we could do a really narrow fix here where we only
ignore the *this* e820 reservation using the properties that:

a) It is "huge"
b) Always ends at 0x00000000cfffffff

To identify it.



I was at first tempted to choose 1 as fix, which basically is also
based on this huge reservation covering the entire 32 bit mem window of
the pci-bridge(s) in the system. But that seems to boil down to the same
thing as 5. Where as 5 can be a really narrowly tailored fix, requiring
only changes to arch/x86/kernel/resource.c . So atm I'm leaning towards
trying 5.  As already said, plase let me know what you think.

Regards,

Hans
