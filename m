No, it was about PCIe hardware failing to handle PM correctly on ports.

There were hardware issues related to PM on x86 platforms predating
the introduction of Connected Standby in Windows.  For instance,
programming a port into D3hot by writing to its PMCSR might cause the
PCIe link behind it to go down and the only way to revive it was to
power cycle the Root Complex.  And similar.

Also, PM has never really worked correctly on PCI (non-PCIe) bridges
and there is this case where the platform firmware handles hotplug and
doesn't want the OS to get in the way (the bridge->is_hotplug_bridge
&& !pciehp_is_native(bridge) check in pci_bridge_d3_possible()).

The DMI check at the end of pci_bridge_d3_possible() is really
something to the effect of "there is no particular reason to prevent
this bridge from going into D3, but try to avoid platforms where it
may not work".

Basically, as far as I'm concerned, this check can be changed into
something like

if (!IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_X86) || dmi_get_bios_year() >=3D 2015)
        return true;

which also requires updating the comment above it accordingly.

This would have been better than the check added by the $subject patch IMV.
