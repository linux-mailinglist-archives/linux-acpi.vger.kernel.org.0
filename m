But it is a bug too.

I can drop the patch, but the current code is simply incorrect.

If the driver provided a ->suspend_late callback, it wanted that
callback to be invoked during the "late" stage of suspend.  Calling it
later simply papers over a driver bug.  If invoking that callback
during the "late" stage doesn't work, the driver should have provided
a "noirq" callback instead.

No.  We need to fix drivers doing wrong things.

Thanks!
