To elaborate on that a little, I think the commit log should describe
the change specifically made by the patch.  You should be able to
"git diff HEAD^" and match up the commit log with that diff output.
You can't do that with this Smatch paragraph.

Adding tags for every reviewer or bot comment seems like overkill.  I
think the "lore" links are about the right level of attribution for
this sort of thing, e.g., here:

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=77d6b9094819ba55353de0ef92957f3f54f2c36c

The Link: tag there gives you the whole v2 thread including review
comments.  And Matthew's cover letter even included a link to the
original v1 posting.  That seems perfect to me.
