Well, if the spec says "rev 5 is the same as rev 4 except for function
Y which is new in rev 5", then arguably the same OS code is also
compliant with rev 5 (it will not use function Y, but that's fine).

If the platform firmware follows the same spec, then the rev 5
implementation in it can be expected to work exactly as its rev 4
implementation either.

I see no problem with using rev 5 instead of rev 4 in that case and nn
new platforms, rev 5 is just as risky as rev 4.

Yes, it did.  It is the same code, as per the above.

So what if there is a platform that only implements revisions greater than =
X?

Presumably, there is another OS targeted by this platform that only
uses revisions X+1 and forward.

I think that there is some confusion in the spec language that seems
to be conflating platforms with interface definitions.

It ostensibly wants the definitions of subsequent revisions of the
same interface to be consistent with each other, which is not a bad
thing in principle IMV, but at the same time it ostensibly allows
platforms to choose which functions to implement, and it doesn't say
anything about the expected behavior when the OS attempts to use a
function that is not implemented for a given rev.

You are right that the backward compatibility language in the _DSM
definition is not enforceable, but it can be regarded as a guidance:
Do not change the interface that you have once defined arbitrarily
between revisions.  After all, if you don't like this guidance, you
can just allocate a new UUID and define a new interface based on it.

Anyway, I'm not the author of this piece of the specification, so I
don't really know the original intent, and it is not sufficiently
clear.

Yes, in this case the backward compatibility language in the _DSM
definition is obviously not followed.
