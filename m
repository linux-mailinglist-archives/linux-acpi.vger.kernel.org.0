Basically, at the pci_acpi_setup() time dev and adev need to be passed to a function that
will add dev as a "dependent device" for each of the power resources in the adev's D0
list.

Next whenever a power resource with a list of "dependent devices" goes _ON successfully,
pm_request_resume() needs to be called for each device in that list.

Finally, at the pci_acpi_cleanup() time, dev needs to be removed from the lists of
"dependent devices" for all power resources in its ACPI companion's D0 list.

At least that's how I see that.
