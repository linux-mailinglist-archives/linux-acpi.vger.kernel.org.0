Up to you.  I hardly looked at the output.

I'd generally prefer to use a single line comment like

/* AC Adapter Management */

but I don't know how often that dashed block is used in ACPI.

grep seems to show the texts are not correctly centered so it seems like
it was done by hand and not that some automation tool was used to create
those blocks.

Maybe a separate patch could be done to change those if desired.
But not by me.

As far as I know, acpi was once autogenerated from a common source tree
and whitespace changes were once frowned on, but maybe that's changed or
or perhaps that's only for files in drivers/acpi/acpica/.  I don't know.
