Thanks a lot for this!

I tried the patch and unfortunately it does not solve the issue but I
think I know what the problem is, see below.

Here. We cannot assume that the parent has ACPI node either. For
instance when PCIe is tunneled over TBT/USB4 there can be several PCIe
switches between the problem endpoint and the root port (which has the
ACPI node of course). I think the safe assumption is to check for the
root port and whether platform_pci_power_manageable() returns true for
it but I may be missing something.
