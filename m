I personally flip flopped between making it pr_info or pr_debug and 
settled on debug because no one else was complaining about the cppc_fie 
consumption. Which to me, meant that the users of platforms utilizing 
PCC regions weren't sensitive to the problem, or weren't yet running a 
distro/kernel with it enabled, or any number of other reasons why the 
problem wasn't getting more attention. Mostly I concluded the FIE code 
hadn't shown up in "enterprise" distros yet..


But, yah, if no one is going to complain about the extra messages 
pr_info() is a better plan.

Thanks for looking at this!
