Ouch, that speaks IMHO completely against exposing it as System RAM as 
default.

At least for passing through memory to VMs (via KVM), you don't actually 
need struct pages / memory exposed to the buddy via 
add_memory_driver_managed(). Actually, doing that sounds like the wrong 
approach.

E.g., you would "allocate" the memory via devdax/dax_hmat and directly 
map the resulting device into guest address space. At least that's what 
some people are doing with
