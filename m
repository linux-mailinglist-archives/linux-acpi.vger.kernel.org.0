Yes, I can add some documentation there.

I think the CRB and OP-TEE based messaging approaches for interacting
with a TZ-based TPM are fundamentally different and I don't see how
to harmonize them through some abstraction.

The OP-TEE TPM protocol copies the TPM command into a temp shared memory
buffer and sends a message to the TPM referencing that buffer.

The CRB uses a permanently shared memory carve-out that in addition
to the command/response data has other fields for locality control,
command control, status, TPM idle, etc. The only 'message' needed is
something to signal 'start'.  Any OS that is FF-A aware and has a
CRB driver can simply add a new start method, which is what this
patch series does.

Nothing yet, but something I am working towards.

It could be either. It doesn't matter from the point of view of
the OS CRB driver. For testing this patch series I used an
internal proof-of-concept fTPM with a CRB interface.

Yes, this is a challenge and there are various ways it could be
implemented. For example, RPMB or if you have an internal root of
trust with secure storage like an RSE that could play a role.

Thanks,
