So what I meant was that many drivers would find it useful to have
a struct device embedded in their 'private structure', and in that case
there would be a duplication of platform_device and acpi_device as
both pointers would be needed. Mind this if you only have struct device
it's easy to get acpi device, but it's not the case the other way around.

So for this driver it's just a matter of sticking to convention, for the others
like it would be duplication.

In my version of this patch we managed to avoid this duplication, thanks
to the contextual argument introduced before, but look at this patch:
https://github.com/mwilczy/linux-pm/commit/cc8ef52707341e67a12067d6ead991d56ea017ca

Author of this patch had to introduce platform_device and acpi_device to the struct ac, so
there was some duplication. That is the case for many drivers to come, so I decided it's better
to change this and have a pattern with keeping only 'struct device'.

Sure, like I've stated before I felt this is part of this patch, we only narrowly
escaped the duplication by introducing contextual argument before ;-)

OK

Sure, haven't reviewed all that use cases yet, but the name 'acpi device'
implies like it's part of a driver framework, and it won't be anymore after
transformations are completed.

Sure that makes sense

Well I can disagree, but still change it ;-). Just explained my reasoning so
you can make a decision with all the data points provided.

Thanks a lot !
