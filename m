OK (and this is important because PCI FW r3.3 is the spec defining the
interface)

IMV with respect to _DSM, the spec that has defined the interface (PCI
FW r3.3) takes precedence over the ACPI spec regardless of what the
latter is saying.  In this case ACPI provides a framework the
interface can be based on, but the actual interface is not defined by
it.

Also, I think that the OS should use rev 6 if it is supported by the
firmware (for all functions) and it should literally follow the
definition of rev 6.

If rev 6 is not supported (or some functions needed by the OS are not
implemented by the firmware), it should fall back to rev 5 and in this
case it should literally follow the definition of rev 5.

And so on.

Yes, it should.

What if the functions on the firmware side depend on each other
interfally and the firmware gets confused if revisions are mixed up on
the OS side?

Since PCI FW r3.3 says that the OS should use the same rev for all
functions, that's what it should do because the firmware may
reasonably assume that it will.

That's what I mean basically.

In practice, the OS needs to assume that the firmware may not
implement a certain rev and so it needs to support other revisions
anyway.
