Here mainly to re-ping folks from Intel (Tony and Dave)  and AMD (Jon

Does you mean /sys/devices/system/node/nodeX/scrub, where scrub is a
virtual concept of scrubbing device that mapps to 1 or several
physical scrubber backends.

For example, starting/stopping the virtual device means issuing
START/STOP cmd to all backends. And...

is it acceptable if we don't provide PA range or region in the
interface *for now* if it complicates things a lot? I could be wrong,
but the user of scrubber seems would be ok with not being able to
scrub an arbitrary physical address range. In contrast, not knowing
the scrub results seems to be more annoying to users. So simply giving
some progress indicator like how many bytes a scrubber has scrubbed.

When we really need to support PA range or region, under the
/sys/devices/system/node/nodeX/scrub interface, it basically uses NUMA
node X's PA range. Then to scrub node memory in range [PA1, PA2), some
driver that understand all backends (or can talk to all backends'
drivers) needs to translate the PA into the address in backend's
address space, for example, [PA1, PA2) is mapped to 2 device ranges
[DA11, DA12) on backend_1 and [DA21, DA22) on backend_2.

CXL memory locally attached to the host is probably more or less the
same as normal physical memory. I wonder what it would be like for CXL
memory remotely attached through a memory pool. Does it make sense
that the controller/owner of the memory pool takes the responsibility
of controlling the CXL memory controller to control scrubbing? Does
the owner need to provide/mediate scrubbing support for other clients
using the memory pool?
