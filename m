I should have mentioned this earlier, but I think the commit log
should include something about the problem this change fixes.  I
assume that the current code changes ExtTag and/or RO, and that causes
something bad.  That's what is motivating this change.

Thanks for digging into that.  You're right that it looks like
e42010d8207f ("PCI: Set Read Completion Boundary to 128 iff Root Port
supports it (_HPX)") was motivated by a machine with a Root Port with
PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_RCB cleared, but an _HPX record telling us to set
PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_RCB.

If we had realized at the time that _HPX Type 2 records are only for
the specific case of an OS that owns PCIe native hotplug but not AER,
we likely could have dropped the PCI_EXP_LNKCTL update completely.

The current behavior is that *if* there is an _HPX Type 2 record, we
set RCB to match the Root Port's RCB, regardless of what the Type 2
record is telling us.  Removing that PCI_EXP_LNKCTL update could
conceivably break something if:

  - Platform has an _HPX Type 2 record, and 

  - Root Port has PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_RCB cleared (only supports 64-byte
    Completions), and

  - Endpoint has PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_RCB set (may return 128-byte
    Completions), which would probably be a configuration error by
    BIOS

Removing it would also give up a little performance if there's a Type
2 record, the Root Port has PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_RCB set (supports 128-byte
Completions), but the Endpoint has PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_RCB cleared (may
only return 64-byte Completions).

I think the fact that we only tweak RCB when an _HPX Type 2 record
exists is bogus.  As far as I can tell, RCB has nothing to do with AER
or hotplug.

I think we probably should add a pci_configure_rcb() called from
pci_configure_device() to always configure RCB to match the Root Port
RCB.  I would do this in a separate patch before removing the update
from program_hpx_type2().
