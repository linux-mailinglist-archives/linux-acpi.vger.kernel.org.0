Ah true, I missed that this would also disable suspend to idle.

Yes, any CXL address range that was provisioned by the OS would need
some off-device save area for the device-state which seems difficult
to support in the general case.

Yeah, that sounds much better, let me explore that option.

Ok, I should have checked, but I'll circle back with sleep state
disabling rather than failing suspend.

Thanks, Rafael.
