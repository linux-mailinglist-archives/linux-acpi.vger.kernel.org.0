As far as I know, the only reason for dev_set_name() to fail is -ENOMEM.  
That's not something the user can control directly.

I don't think any of the failure paths here are controlled by the user.  
They all seem to involve something going wrong internally in the kernel 
(i.e., corruption or memory allocation failure for a small buffer).  
Once that happens, the game is pretty much over anyway.

Is it worth handling this sort of thing, or should we ignore the 
possibility and allow it to escalate to the point where the user can 
potentially trigger a kernel panic?  Another way of putting it is: How 
gracefully do you want the kernel to collapse when this sort of 
corruption happens?
