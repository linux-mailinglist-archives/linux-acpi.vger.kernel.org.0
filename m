In the original design (page 11 of [1]),

[1] https://lpc.events/event/16/contributions/1209/attachments/1042/1995/Live%20In%20a%20World%20With%20Multiple%20Memory%20Types.pdf

the default memory tier hierarchy is based on the performance from CPU
point of view.  Then the abstract distance of a memory type (e.g., GPU
HBM) can be adjusted via a sysfs knob
(<memory_type>/abstract_distance_offset) based on the requirements of
GPU.

That's another possible solution.
