Yes, for all firmware property providers there is a callback.

Point to what? This arch/x86/kernel/devicetree.c ?

Do they support Device Tree? Do you want to enable them in ACPI environment?

Please do.

Which chip? Flash memory / ROM or you meant something like FPGA here?
For the latter there is another discussion on how to use DT overlays
in ACPI-enabled environments for the FPGA configurations.

Yes, but it misses details about board files approach. See also above.

What does "emulation" mean? Can you elaborate a bit?
