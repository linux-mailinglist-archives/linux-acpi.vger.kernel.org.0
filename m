Thanks Rafael and this aligns with my understanding. I had mentioned to
Suzuki informally. Since I wasn't sure why this was not covered under
Arm ACPI maintainership for whatever historical reasons, I didn't make
it formally on the list. I think it would be better if we move that file
under it to be explicit and avoid any confusion in the future. I will
send the update soon.
