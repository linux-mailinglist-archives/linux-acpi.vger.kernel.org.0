I found another angle at the problem. According to the ACPI spec v6.4
section 16.2 cache flushing is required on the way to S1, S2 and S3.
And according to 8.2 it also is required on the way to C3.

TDX doesn't support these S- and C-states. TDX is only supports S0 and S5.

Adjusting code to match the spec would make TDX work automagically.

Any opinions on the patch below?

I didn't touch ACPI_FLUSH_CPU_CACHE() users in cpufreq/longhaul.c because
it might be outside of ACPI spec, I donno.
