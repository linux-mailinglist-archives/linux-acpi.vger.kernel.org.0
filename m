I think it's more than questionable.  I think a bridge is *required*
to be in D0 if any downstream device is in D0.  Based on the PCI PM
spec r1.2, sec 6, table 6-1, if the bridge is not in D0, there can be
no PCI transactions on its secondary bus.

I don't know what to do with "may confuse some firmware"; it doesn't
say what firmware is affected or why, so it sort of leads to "we can
never touch this code because we don't know what might break."

But IMO the first reason by itself is more than enough to keep a
bridge in D0 if any downstream device is in D0.

Maybe "Per PCI PM r1.2, table 6-1, a bridge must be in D0 if any
downstream device is in D0"?
