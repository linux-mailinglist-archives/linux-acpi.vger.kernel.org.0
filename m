The way the mailbox core behaves when you pass a NULL `mssg` parameter
to mbox_send_message() is a little questionable. Specifically, the
mailbox core stores the currently active message directly in its
`active_req` field. In at least two places it decides that if this
field is `NULL` then there is no active request. That means if `mssg`
is ever NULL it will cause the mailbox core to think is no active
request. The two places where it does this are:

1. When a client calls mbox_send_message(), if `active_req` is NULL
   then it will call the mailbox controller to send the new message
   even if the mailbox controller hasn't yet called mbox_chan_txdone()
   on the previous (NULL) message.
2. The mailbox core will never call the client's `tx_done()` callback
   with a NULL message because `tx_tick()` returns early whenever the
   message is NULL.

Though the above doesn't look like it was a conscious design choice,
it does have the benefit of providing a simple way to assert an
edge-triggered interrupt to the remote processor on the other side of
the mailbox. Specifically:

1. Like a normal edge-triggered interrupt, if multiple edges arrive
   before the interrupt is Acked they are coalesced.
2. Like a normal edge-triggered interrupt, as long as the receiver
   (the remote processor in this case) "Ack"s the interrupt _before_
   checking for work and the sender (the mailbox client in this case)
   posts the interrupt _after_ adding new work then we can always be
   certain that new work will be noticed. This assumes that the
   mailbox client and remote processor have some out-of-band way to
   communicate work and the mailbox is just being used as an
   interrupt.

Doing a `git grep -A1 mbox_send_message | grep NULL` shows 14 hits in
mainline today, but it's not 100% clear if all of those users are
relying on the benefits/quirks of the existing behavior.

Since the current NULL `mssg` behavior is a bit questionable but has
some benefits, let's:

1. Deprecate the NULL behavior and print a warning.
2. Add a new mbox_ring_doorbell() function that is very similar to the
   existing NULL `mssg` case but a tad bit cleaner.

The design of the new mbox_ring_doorbell() will be to maximize
compatibility with the old NULL `mssg` behavior. Specifically:

* We'll still pass NULL to the mailbox controller to indicate a
  doorbell.
* Doorbells will not be queued and won't have txdone.
* We'll call immediately into the mailbox controller when a doorbell
  is posted.

With the above, any mailbox clients that don't mix doorbells and
normal messages are intended to see no change in behavior when
switching to the new API. Using the new API, which officiall documents
that mbox_client_txdone() shouldn't be called for doorbells, does
allow us to remove those calls.

There are two differences in behavior between the old sending a NULL
message and the new mbox_ring_doorbell():

1. If the mailbox controller returned an error when trying to send a
   NULL message, the old NULL message could have ended up being queued
   up in the core's FIFO. Now we will just return the error.
2. If a client rings a doorbell while a non-doorbell message is in
   progress, previously NULL messages would have been "queued" in that
   case and now doorbells will be immediately posted.

I'm hoping that nobody was relying on either of the two differences.
In general holding NULL messages in the mailbox core's queue has odd
behavior and is hard to reason about. Hopefully it's reasonable to
assume nobody was doing this.

As mentioned above, it should be noted that it's now documented that
"txdone" shouldn't be called (by both mailbox drivers and clients) for
doorbells. That being said, in most cases it won't hurt since the
mailbox core will ignore the bogus "txdone". The only case where it's
critical for a mailbox controller not to call "txdone" for a doorbell
is when a mailbox channel mixes normal messages and doorbells and
cares about the txdone callback. Specifically, when you ring a
doorbell and immediately send a normal message, if the controller
calls "txdone" for the doorbell it could look as if the normal message
finished before it should have. This issue also would have happened
with the old NULL `mssg`, though.
