Hi Rafael,

Any further feedback on this? Do you see any issues with fw_devlink and
pnp_irq() changes for the interrupt controller dependency?

BTW, I explored the _DEP option you mentioned. But I think the current
approach would probably be better with lesser impact than _DEP. Below are
my findings.

1) When PNP device like PNP0501 (16550A UART) has _DEP, it does not get
created in the first pass (as expected) but they won't get created even
after the supplier clears the dependency. This is because
acpi_pnp_attach() returns success without calling pnpacpi_add_device()
when acpi_scan_clear_dep_fn() calls acpi_bus_attach(). Either
acpi_pnp_attach() needs to be modified or pnpacpi_add_device()
should be called as part of clearing the dependency. I may be wrong but
I think modifying pnp_irq() would probably affect only RISC-V than any
of the approaches above.

2) _DEP doesn't support PCI devices. When we have PCI link devices
(PNP0C0F) in the _PRT, the PCI driver probe as part of PCI scan can happen
prior to link device probe since link device will have dependency on the
interrupt controller which may not be probed yet. This will cause issue
to the PCI device driver init because _PRT says there is link device for
legacy PCI interrupt routing but the link driver is not probed yet.

3) _DEP needs namespace interrupt controllers. We would like to avoid
adding namespace devices also along with MADT.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
Sunil
