That's a good question. I would think they have those but I cannot be
sure for all the existing ones. I checked the RPL system I have here and
it does have _S0W and the HotPlugSupportInD3 at least.

I think it might be worthile to dig into it futher. Not sure if this
helps at all but the matching PEP constraint for the one of the root
ports mentioned above looks like this:

               Package (0x03)
               {
                    "\\_SB.PC00.RP09",
                    Zero,
                    Package (0x02)
                    {
                        Zero, 
                        Package (0x02)
                        {
                            0xFF, 
                            0x03
                        }
                    } 
                },
