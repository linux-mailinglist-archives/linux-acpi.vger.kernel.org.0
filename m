Well it adds the information that the workaround (to the workaround)
which we added for this case is working as expected and it allows
seeing that is the case in a single glance.

Yes we can derive this is happening from the other logs, but it won't
"stand out" unless you are specifically looking for it. Having
a separate line which stands-out (a bit) might be helpful to spot
this when debugging something else which seems unrelated, but
possibly is actually related.

Anyways, I'll leave what to do here up to you.

Right, which is why I suggest using dev_info and not dev_warn.

I'm not sure about always logging the EFI memmap I agree it might
be useful sometimes, but it is easy to enable then and the initial
boot code of the kernel already is pretty "chatty".
