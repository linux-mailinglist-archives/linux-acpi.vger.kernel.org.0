Hi, Alistair,

Sorry for late response.  Just come back from vacation.

In the current design, the abstract distance is the key concept of
memory types and memory tiers.  And it is used as interface to allocate
memory types.  This provides more flexibility than some other interfaces
(e.g. read/write bandwidth/latency).  For example, in current
dax/kmem.c, if HMAT isn't available in the system, the default abstract
distance: MEMTIER_DEFAULT_DAX_ADISTANCE is used.  This is still useful
to support some systems now.  On a system without HMAT/CDAT, it's
possible to calculate abstract distance from ACPI SLIT, although this is
quite limited.  I'm not sure whether all systems will provide read/write
bandwith/latency data for all memory devices.

HMAT and CDAT or some other mechanisms may provide the read/write
bandwidth/latency data to be used to calculate abstract distance.  For
them, we can provide a shared implementation in mm/memory-tiers.c to map
from read/write bandwith/latency to the abstract distance.  Can this
solve your concerns about the consistency among algorithms?  If so, we
can do that when we add the second algorithm that needs that.
