My concerns are more about:
- The GCC version of the feature not being fully baked yet, which
makes it hard to have full confidence in its implementation (surely,
GCC has a test case or two with a switch scope variable declaration;
- We waste the credit we have with other developers who care less
about security on things that we could have fixed before they'd even
notice. What will happen the next time around when we *really* need
source level changes?

So how is this

switch {
var foo;
case x:
   ...
}

fundamentally different from

{
var foo;
switch {
case x:
   ...
}
}

Surely, some kind of transformation is possible where the var
declaration is hoisted into a parent scope added around the entire
switch {} statement?

Not sure I get the shampoo reference, but I just don't think this
idiom meets the bar for code that really needs modification for the
compiler to be able to do the right thing.
