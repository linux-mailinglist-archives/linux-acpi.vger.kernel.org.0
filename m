My point is that this is clear abuse of the spec and:
1) we have to enable the broken, because it is already in the wild with
   the comment that this is an issue

AND

2) issue an ECR / work with MS to make sure they understand the problem.

This can be done in parallel. What I meant as a prerequisite is to start doing
2) while we have 1) on table.
