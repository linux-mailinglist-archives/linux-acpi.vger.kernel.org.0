No, I agree, I think the original checks were simplified along the way 
to that. It wasn't 'right' either.

The problem is that there are three subtypes of which processor is only 
one, and that struct acpi_pptt_processor doesn't necessarily reflect the 
actual size of the processor structure in the table because it has 
optional private resources tagged onto the end.

So if the bug being fixed is that the length check is validating that 
the table length is less than the data in the table, that's still a 
problem because its only validating the processor node without resources.

AKA the return is still potentially returning a pointer to a structure 
which may not be entirely contained in the table.
