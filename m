One thing to note is we could minimize the changes to the code by
getting the bus on which a device resides directly rather than
bouncing via the root port and back again.

Something like
-       if (!(pci_pcie_type(dev) == PCI_EXP_TYPE_ROOT_PORT ||
-             pci_pcie_type(dev) == PCI_EXP_TYPE_DOWNSTREAM))
-               dev = dev->bus->self;
-       bus = dev->subordinate;
-
+       if ((pci_pcie_type(dev) == PCI_EXP_TYPE_ROOT_PORT ||
+            pci_pcie_type(dev) == PCI_EXP_TYPE_DOWNSTREAM))
+               bus = dev->subordinate;
+       else
+               bus = dev->bus;
+       if (bus->self)
+               dev = bus->self;

(with some special handling to avoid calling root port specific
parts on the RCiEP)

We could check pci_is_root_bus for that last check and it might be
slightly more informative.

But then an AER error on an RCiEP resets everything on the same bus
within the Root Complex.  

I don't think we want to do this as the same logic about resetting the
PCIe bus and everything below doesn't really apply.

Hence I'll try the pci_walk_bus variant as previously suggested.
