Hi,

Thanks for looking at this.

That is the intention of the uefi properties registry I referred to 
earlier. It has a code first model too, which allows us to review it 
here and then update the document with the property and the intended 
behavior.

This is really just a stand in for the existing MCFG oem id, its an 
identifier to key off, nothing else.  Maybe a better name is 
"linux-ecam-quirk-id" or something to that effect?

Yes, and no, I think there was some discussion a few years back about 
using non standard HID's for these nonstandard implementations, but that 
was discouraged at the time in favor of using the standard identifiers 
and and keying off a Soc/platform specific ID to enable a "quirk". Given 
we are a bit far down that path and the decision was made to continue 
down it (rather than solving much of it with a new firmware interface) 
this seems like the straightforward solution. The vast majority of these 
are SoC specific, and just minor tweaks for alignment/etc. Given its an 
ACPI/UEFI machine we are already hiding a lot of the platform specific 
behavior for configuring the bridge/etc that might require DT like 
properties in the firmware.


Thanks again.
