They are special-cased in that function already, because it updates an
upstream port for a change in a downstream device.

There are only 2 places really affected by no_d3cold:
pci_dev_check_d3cold() and the ACPI power state selection for PCI
devices. where the former is used for checking whether or not it is
valid to put an upstream bridge into D3hot/cold (which depends on
whether or not the downstream devices below it are allowed to use
D3cold).

The only place where no_d3cold affects root ports is the ACPI power
state selection, because the only way to program a root port into
D3cold is via ACPI.

Right, because (as per the PCI PM spec) putting an upstream bridge
into D3hot/cold effectively removes power from the bus segment below
it, so the devices on that bus segment go into D3cold.  If they are
not allowed to go into D3cold, the bridge needs to stay in a shallower
power state either.

Because it makes no_d3cold affect the ability of the given root port
to be programmed into D3hot via PMCSR.
