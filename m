The problem is AFAIK because the root port doesn't do that.

AFAIK, what is happening here the CPU core has an outstanding R/W 
request for which it never receives a response from the root port. So 
basically its an interconnect protocol violation that the CPU is 
complaining about rather than something PCIe specific.

Hmm, I thought I had wrapped these, but probably at 78, guess I will 
rebase/repost.

Yes, that is basically where we are because the reason for the exception 
can't really be pinned down. There are some thoughts about ways to work 
around the problem, but they aren't pretty and probably need to be done 
at an exception level higher than what the kernel is operating at. Hence 
the SMC.

Yes, that would be part of SBSA, which of course this platform isn't.
