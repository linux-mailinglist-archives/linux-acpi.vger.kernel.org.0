in case of reported laptop, DSDT provides Device Descriptors
for not existing root-ports.

OSPM can't do anything with it but to pass Notify event to
PCI bus-specific enumeration mechanism, and it's upto PCI subsystem
to discard/ignore Notify() on this ACPI node.

I think I can mock this case by hacking QEMU, that should help
with finding a proper place to fix it.

(here it is:
https://gitlab.com/imammedo/qemu/-/commits/acpiphp_buscheck_on_missing_device?ref_type=heads
I'll post hack patch as a reply to this email for posterity)

While ACPI doesn't forbid firmware to describe non-existing RP,
the PCIe hostbridge can't hotplug extra root ports. (and QEMU
follows PCIe design in this respect on 'q35' machine).

However when it comes to hotplug on QEMU's 'pc' machine
(hotplug on root bus), each slot has "Augmented Device
Descriptors", that includes un-populated slots leading to
the presence of .notify() handler on such slots.

Then later on when device is hotplugged, a Notify(,1/*DeviceCheck*/)
is sent to previously empty slot and from there on PCI subsystem
re-enumerates either a single device or a bridge hierarchy
(from the parent context).

So I'd assume that we need to have .notify() handler for all slots
that are described in DSDT (present and non present).

I've not put extra arguments, because there is a lot of ways
one can configure/use monitor/serial options.

But specifying full command line like yours will be useful
for anyone who doesn't have any experience with QEMU CLI.

I've looked at possibility of making 
  pci_assign_unassigned_bridge_resources()
work without bridge pointer, but it looks not viable as it's
a bridge dedicated function which on top of rearranging
resources, also disables/reprograms/enables bridge.

If there are ideas how to make it better,
I can pick it up and try to implement.

Testing shows that pci_assign_unassigned_bridge_resources()
isn't ideal since it releases all resources before reassigning
and then if the later fails bridge stays in mis-configured
state (attempt to recover results in failing BAR assignment
to children devices).
It's not issue in case of
  root-port -> 1 child device hotplug
since root port hadn't any working device[s] behind it.
But in case of hotplug into PCI bridge, that leaves
pre-existing devices behind the bridge broken (SHPC and acpiphp case).

works for me, tested with:
  1: hotplug on root bus with QEMU's 'pc' machine,
  2: (q35 machine) igb emulation, and adding VFs once guest is booted
  3: BusCheck on missing PCI device (aka simulated env of reporter)
  4: (q35 machine) resource re-allocation still works on root ports when
     a device with large BARs is hotplugged
