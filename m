Ok! So writing to config space cause asynchronous abort.

Looking at the codes and 0x96000210 on all ARMv8 should be Data Abort.
0xbf...... on ARMv8 is SError interrupt and other bits are CPU core
specific. What CPU core do you have on this machine? I have just decoder
for A53 core and on this core value 0xbf000002 means "SLVERR on external
access". But I guess that it would mean also SLVERR for your CPU core.

Because Exactly same behavior I'm seeing with PCIe controller on A3720
SoC which has A53 core. It looks like that PCIe controller translates
PCIe CA and UR responses to AXI SLVERR responses which are delivered to
CPU and kernel just see these fatal error interrupts. And same issue is
not only for config requests but also for memory read / write commands.

In my case PCIe controller really receives response (timeout does not
occur) from PCIe core (which probably timeouts as it cannot send message
when link is down) but instead of translating them to SLVOK with
fabricated 0xffffffff response it sends to CPU that fatal SLVERR.

I was told that the fix for this kind of issue is to "reconfigure" PCIe
controller to never send SLVERR to CPU. And instead fabricate 0xffffffff
SLVOK response. It should be configurable in PCIe wrapper or PCIe glue
IP which do connection between CPU / AXI and PCIe core.

I do not know if there is any way how to "ignores" these SLVERR
responses from PCIe controller sent to CPU.
