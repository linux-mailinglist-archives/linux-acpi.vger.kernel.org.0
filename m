It's a failed / aborted hibernation case so _PTS was called by the hibernating
kernel (this call turned off modem power) but nothing has turned it back on.

While a failed hibernation entry might sound like a corner case in practice
it is far from it unfortunately - I start to experience it regularly after
about 2 weeks of uptime when the machine RAM usage starts to exceed 50%
(I start to get memory allocation failures during hibernation as that other
50% of RAM gets used by AFAIK snapshot copy of the memory).

Other things, like for example btrfs scrub running in background, or active
wake event may also cause failed hibernation entry.

What's worse, even successful hibernation and restore after that doesn't
bring back the modem to the working state - a clean reboot of the machine
is necessary for that.

As I wrote above, in this case there's no actual power cycle of the
entire machine, so AFAIK this power resource isn't re-added.

This platform has just 12 power resources so checking their names on
resume path is hardly a significant overhead:

Will create a replacement __acpi_power_on() for this power resource
(including the power OFF and delay part) and call it from
acpi_resume_power_resources() instead of ordinary __acpi_power_on()
on this platform.

Will do.

As far as I can see this power resource only needs special handling
on the resume path.
The initialization path or normal runtime power switching path do not
need any special handling of this power resource.
