Subject: [PATCH 0/3] CM4 ACPI PCIe quirk
Date:   Thu,  5 Aug 2021 16:11:57 -0500

The PFTF CM4 is an ACPI platform that is following the PCIe SMCCC
standard because its PCIe config space isn't ECAM compliant and is
split into two parts. One part for the root port registers and a
moveable window which points at a given device's 4K config space.
Thus it doesn't have a MCFG (and really any MCFG provided would be
nonsense anyway). As linux doesn't support the PCIe SMCCC standard
we key off a linux specific host bridge _DSD to add custom ECAM
ops and cfgres. The cfg op selects between those two regions, as
well as disallowing problematic accesses, particularly if the link
is down because there isn't an attached device.

Jeremy Linton (3):
  PCI: brcmstb: Break register definitions into separate header
  PCI: brcmstb: Add ACPI config space quirk
  PCI/ACPI: Add new quirk detection, enable bcm2711
