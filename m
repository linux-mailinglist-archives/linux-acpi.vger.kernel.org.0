No, it should not be in pci.txt. Nothing to do with DT and I don't
review ACPI bindings (someone should) if I can help it.

It's only Linux specific until it's not.

What happens when there's a second PCIe quirk here? Say what the quirk
is (and not in terms of Linux policy).

Don't you know the device here and can imply all this (like implying
off of 'compatible' in DT)? Adding properties to address issues
creates compatibility issues. Maybe not an issue in this case if the
firmware is not stable, but not a good practice to be in.
