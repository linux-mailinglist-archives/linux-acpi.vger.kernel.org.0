The TCG defined ACPI table has the following:
    -Physical address of the TPM
    -Start method
    -Start method specific parameters
    -event log address

This has been in place 8+ years and this is what OSes expect.
The start method advertises the mechanism a driver uses to
signal the TPM that something has changed in the CRB, and
this allows different types of TPM implementations:
    -memory mapped
    -signal via ACPI
    -signal via ARM SMC (legacy)
    -signal via Pluton mailbox
    -signal via FF-A

I don't see this as overloading the ACPI table, it's just what
the OS needs to know.

The TPM does not know (and should not know) the address of
the event log. An FF-A based TPM has no way to know this.

I don't see how changing TPM discovery to be via FF-A directly
would improve maintainability.

If we added new CRB/FF-A ABIs to get the CRB physical address,
start method specific parameters, event log, it would mean that
all OSes and hypervisors need to re-architect their CRB drivers
or create new FF-A specific CRB drivers.  That will not smooth
enablement for TPMs.  And I don't see advantages for
maintainability.

Thanks,
Stuart
