Sorry for this mess! My intention was to summarise my suggestion in the form of a patch,
I wasn't expecting you to pick it up. (and I didn't post it because there was ongoing
discussion on the second part)

I'll repost this with the Co-Developed-by stuff. You'll need to re-post it with the
series, you'll need to move your Signed-Off-By to be last when you do that.


Thanks,

James
