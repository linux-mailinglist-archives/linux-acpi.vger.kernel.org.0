Configuration is done at pmem namespace creation time.  The metadata for
the namespace indicates where the memmap resides.  See the
ndctl-create-namespace man page:

       -M, --map=3D
           A pmem namespace in "fsdax" or "devdax" mode requires allocation=
 of
           per-page metadata. The allocation can be drawn from either:

           =C2=B7   "mem": typical system memory

           =C2=B7   "dev": persistent memory reserved from the namespace

                   Given relative capacities of "Persistent Memory" to "Sys=
tem
                   RAM" the allocation defaults to reserving space out of t=
he
                   namespace directly ("--map=3Ddev"). The overhead is 64-b=
ytes per
                   4K (16GB per 1TB) on x86.

Right.  (btw, I don't think system ram mode existed back then.)

Agreed.

I believe the main driver was the size.  At the time, Intel was
advertising 3TiB/socket for pmem.  I can't remember the exact DRAM
configuration sizes from the time.

Part of the issue was preserving the media.  The page structure gets
lots of updates, and that could cause premature wear.

I'm glad you're asking these questions.  We definitely want to make sure
we don't conflate requirements based on some particular
technology/implementation.  Also, I wouldn't make any assumptions about
the performance of CXL devices.  As I understand it, there could be a
broad spectrum of performance profiles.

And now Dan can correct anything I got wrong.  ;-)

Cheers,
Jeff
