I'd be pretty surprised if the host bridge window actually full --
[mem 0x65400000-0xbfffffff] is a pretty big range and these devices
only need 4K each.

But maybe we aren't smart enough when trying to allocate space.
Places like __pci_bus_size_bridges() and __pci_assign_resource() are
full of assumptions about what PCI BARs can go where, depending on
64bit-ness, prefetchability, etc.

Maybe instrumenting those allocation paths would give some insight.
Possibly we should go ahead and merge some permanent pci_dbg() stuff
there too.

I do note that the working "pci=nocrs" case puts these devices above
4GB.  _CRS only told you about host bridge windows *below* 4GB, and
Linux will never assign space that's outside the windows (except in
the "pci=nocrs" case, of course).

Sorry, I just meant that instead of "Booting with nocrs ...", I'd like
the commit log to say "Booting with 'pci=nocrs' ..." so that
non-expert users reading it will have a bit of a head start on how to
try this themselves.
