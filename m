It's not a bug that errors that happen before the callback are lost.
At least, it's not a *Linux* bug.  It might be a poor design of the
firmware error reporting interface.

If the only point of this patch is to reduce the time before GHES
initialization, the commit log should clearly say that.

[Tangent: I think this GHES message is confusing.  What "APEI bit"
does this refer to?  The only bits I remember are the Flags bits in
HEST Error Source Descriptor Entries, e.g., ACPI v6.3, sec 18.3.2.

"WHEA _OSC" means nothing to me, and I didn't find anything useful
with grep, other than that "WHEA" might be an obsolete name for what
we now call "APEI".

I don't think there's anything in _OSC that mentions "firmware first."

I don't remember anything in the spec about a way to *enable* Firmware
First Error Handling needing (I'm looking at ACPI v6.3, sec 18.4).

I think the "firmware first" information is useless to the OS -- as
far as I can tell, the spec says nothing about anything the OS should
do based on the FIRMWARE_FIRST bits.]

I don't know why acpi_hest_init() is called from acpi_pci_root_init().
It looks like HEST can support error sources other than PCI (IA-32
Machine Checks, NMIs, GHES, etc.)  It was added by 415e12b23792
("PCI/ACPI: Request _OSC control once for each root bridge (v3)");
maybe Rafael remembers why.

Seem like acpi_hest_init(), sdei_init(), and ghes_init() should all go
somewhere else, but I don't know where.  Maybe somewhere in
acpi_init()?
