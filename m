It doesn't need to be on top of my series, so if you have an idea,
please just let me know what it is.

It can't be entirely in the ACPI driver AFAICS, though, because
trips[i] need to be modified on updates and they belong to the core.
Hence, the driver needs some help from the core to get to them.  It
can be something like "this is my trip tag and please give me the
address of the trip matching it" or similar, but it is needed, because
the driver has to assume that the trip indices used by it initially
may change.
