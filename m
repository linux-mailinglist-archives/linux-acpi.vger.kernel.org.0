Well, to be honest, if you are a "vertical" vendor and you control the
entire stack, *including* the platform firmware, it would be kind of
OK for you to do that in a product kernel.

However, this is not a practical thing to do in the mainline kernel
which must work for everybody, including people who happen to use
systems with broken or even actively unfriendly firmware on them.

So I'm inclined to say that IMO this series "as is" would not be an
improvement from the mainline perspective.

I guess it would make sense to have an attribute for user space to
write to in order to make the kernel reject device plug-in events
coming from a given port or connector, but the kernel has no reliable
means to determine *which* ports or connectors are "safe", and even if
there was a way for it to do that, it still may not agree with user
space on which ports or connectors should be regarded as "safe".

Cheers!
