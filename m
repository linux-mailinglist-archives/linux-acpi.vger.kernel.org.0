The code to actually find the memory region and make the OS aware of it isn't
yet present. It's next on the list of things to work on in fact. You can look
for that in v4.

With QEMU patches in my gitlab, the memory isn't even made a region. There is a
#define you can set:
diff --git a/hw/mem/cxl_type3.c b/hw/mem/cxl_type3.c
index dee5a8884b..60c774840e 100644
--- a/hw/mem/cxl_type3.c
+++ b/hw/mem/cxl_type3.c
@@ -13,6 +13,8 @@
 #include "sysemu/hostmem.h"
 #include "hw/cxl/cxl.h"

+#define SET_PMEM_ADDR
+
 typedef struct cxl_type3_dev {
     /* Private */
     PCIDevice parent_obj;

With that, even though you won't see the range in Linux, the memory device
should work if you send cycles to the address range at 0x4c0000000.

Thanks.
