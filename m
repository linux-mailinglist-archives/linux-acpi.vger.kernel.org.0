Dan, Bjorn, I did a fairly randomized look at various probe functions and ENODEV
seems to be more common. My sort of historical use has been
- ENODEV: General, couldn't establish device presence
- ENXIO: Device was there but something is totally misconfigured
- E*: A matching errno for exactly what went wrong

My question though is, would it be useful to propagate the error up through
probe?
