Both 'packed' and 'aligned(4)' remove any structure alignment
padding before 64bit items that aren't on an 8 byte boundary.
(Because everything else in the structures is naturally aligned.)

The difference is significant on cpu that don't support misaligned
addresses.
Assuming that the structure is always on a 4n byte boundary
(which the ACPI spec probably requires) accesses to the 32-bit
fields are always ok.
It is only 64-bit fields that must be accessed as two 32-bit
memory cycles, not all the fields using multiple single byte
cycles.
