IMO, SC8280XP is not a very good model platform for ACPI firmware reference.
It uses PEP which Linux doesn't support for good reason and that make it
hard to follow everything on that platform.

I am not 100% sure

Also bypassing certain operation taken care in sleep.c might result in
missing certain features. Few things IIRC(might be missing things myself
or misunderstood as it has been a while since I looked at the code in
detail): handing of GPE for wakeup, power resource handling during the
resume, power button event to mention few.
