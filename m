Not drop completely. This patch copied the code used to read _DSD
properties under PCI root ports. But I agree that such properties
should apply to all devices on those ports and unfortuntely that's not
the case here. BIOS got it wrong. My thought in dropping this patch is
to rewrite it to read the property directly from the nvme driver. Not
the way it's typically done either but it would avoid a global change
in the pci core while allowing us to deal with the firmware we have.
