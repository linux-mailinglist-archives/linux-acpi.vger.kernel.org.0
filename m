This would be a firmware defect, IMHO.  There is a mechanism (_DSM for
preserving PCI Boot Configurations) for the firmware to tell us about
things that can't be moved.

This would be another defect, in the device this time.  If we can
identify the device, possibly we could quirk around it.

Either one will be back to bite us in the future if we support
rebalancing resources to make room for hot-added devices.  I *think*
Windows already supports this kind of rebalancing.  Anyway, this is
why we need to dig a little deeper to figure out exactly what's going
wrong here.
