I really want to clarify the dmesg logging such that it's clear that
PNP0C02 reservation is the only valid way to reserve the space
described by MCFG.  Obviously we have to retain the fallbacks, but I
think there should be FW_BUG logging in that case.  We currently only
do FW_INFO for missing PNP0C02 reservations.

I think we should try to change FWTS so it validates MCFG addresses
against the PNP0C02 reservations required by spec, instead of
searching E820 for them.  The spec doesn't require MCFG regions to be
in E820, and I think searching there encourages the wrong behavior.
It probably also doesn't work at all on arm64, since it doesn't have
E820 at all.

The /sys/devices/pnp0/00:xx/resources files and "system 00:xx: [mem
...] has been reserved" lines in dmesg would be much better places to
check.
