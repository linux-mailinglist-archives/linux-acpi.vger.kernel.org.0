From: Alexander Graf <graf@amazon.com>

We create a list of ACPI "PNP" IDs which contains _HID, _CID, and CLS
entries of the respective devices. However, we squeeze them into struct
acpi_device_id, which only has 9 bytes space to store the identifier. It
originally had 16 bytes, but was changed to only have 9 in 6543becf26ff
("mod/file2alias: make modalias generation safe for cross compiling"),
presumably on the theory that it would match the ACPI spec so it didn't
matter.

Unfortunately, while most people adhere to the ACPI specs, Microsoft
decided that its VM Generation Counter device [1] should only be
identifiable by _CID with a value of "VM_Gen_Counter", which is longer
than 9 characters.

To allow device drivers to match identifiers that exceed the 9 byte
limit, this simply ups the length to 16, just like it was before the
aforementioned commit. Empirical testing indicates that this
doesn't actually increase vmlinux size, because the ulong in the same
struct caused there to be 7 bytes of padding anyway.

This patch is a prerequisite to add support for VMGenID in Linux, the
subsequent patch in this series. It has been confirmed to also work on
the udev/modalias side in userspace.

Hi Rafael & Len,

This patchset is directed toward you two specifically. Patches 1/3 and
3/3 have been through the ringer of review a bit already and do not
specifically require your attention, but in v4 we wound up getting hung
up on an ACPI API limitation. This v5 fixes that limitation with this
2/3 patch that you see here, with a trivial one line fix, which does
require your attention.

Patches 1/3 and 3/3 will go through my random.git tree. However, 3/3
actually depends on this one here, 2/3, in order to compile without
warnings (and be functional at all). Therefore, it would be nice if you
would provide an "Acked-by" on it and permit me to /also/ take it
through my random.git tree (if it looks like a correct patch to you, of
course). This would make the merge logistics a lot easier. Plus it's a
small +1/-1 line change.

Please have a look and let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Jason
