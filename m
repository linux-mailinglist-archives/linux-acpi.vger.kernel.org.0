Hi,

Thanks for taking a look at this!

Sure, I will reduce the .h to just the register definitions, guard it, 
and tweak maintainers to cover pcie-brcmstb*.

Yes, given I don't know what those changes are I can't predict how they 
would have to be handled, or even if the platform would be a target of 
the community maintaining the UEFI/ACPI port on the RPi. So punting on 
that topic seems a reasonable solution at the moment. Better yet, more 
of the linux community will see the advantage of the firmware interface 
and this platform can utilize that method.
