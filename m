Hi,

Thanks a for you reviewing my patch.

OK, will be fixed at the next version.

There are a few reasons, please fixed me if I'm wrong.

DT (overlay) can be possible solution, but DT (overlay) still depend on DT.
For example, one of my x86 computer with Ubuntu 22.04 Linux/x86 6.5.0-28-generic
kernel configuration do not has the DT enabled. This means that the default kernel
configuration is decided by the downstream OS distribution. It is not decided by
usual programmers. This means that out-of-tree device drivers can never utilize
DT or DT overlay, right?

I means that Linux kernel is intended to be used by both in-tree drivers and out-of-tree drivers.
Out-of-tree device drivers don't have a chance to alter kernel config, they can only managed to
get their source code compiled against the Linux kernel the host in-using.

Some out-of-tree device drivers using DKMS to get their source code compiled,
with the kernel configuration already *fixed*. So they don't have a opportunity
to use DT overlay.

Relying on DT overlay is *still* *DT* *dependent*, and I not seeing matured solution
get merged into upstream kernel yet. However, software node has *already* been merged
into Linux kernel. It can be used on both DT systems and non-DT systems. Software node
has the least requirement, it is *handy* for interact with drivers who only need a small
set properties.

In short, I still think my patch maybe useful for some peoples. DT overlay support on
X86 is not matured yet, need some extra work. For out-of-tree kernel module on
downstream kernel. Select DT and DT overlay on X86 is out-of-control. And I don't want
to restrict the freedom of developers.

Because the drm/tiny/repaper driver and drm/tiny/st7735r driver requires extra
device properties. We can not make them OF-independent simply by switching to
device_get_match_data(). As the device_get_match_data() is a *no-op* on non-DT
environment.

Hence, before my patch is applied, the two "Make driver OF-independent" patch
have no effect. Using device_get_match_data() itself is exactly *same* with
using of_device_get_match_data() as long as the .device_get_match_data hook is
not implemented.


See my analysis below:

When the .device_get_match_data hook is not implemented:

1) On DT systems, device_get_match_data() just redirect to of_fwnode_device_get_match_data(),
    which is just a wrapper of of_device_get_match_data().

2) On Non-DT system, device_get_match_data() has *ZERO* effect, it just return NULL.


Therefore, device_get_match_data() adds *ZERO* benefits to the mentioned drivers if
the .device_get_match_data is not implemented.

  
Only when the .device_get_match_data hook get implemented, device_get_match_data()
can redirect tosoftware_node_get_match_data() function in this patch. Therefore, the 
two driver has a way to get a proper driver match data on non-DT 
environment. Beside, the users of those two driver can provide 
additional software node property at platform setup code. as long as at 
somewhere before the driver is probed.

So the two driver really became OF-independent after applied my patch.

OK, thanks a lot for teaching me.

Nope, I think this is kind of limitation of the software node,
platform setup code generally could provide a compatible property.
No duplicate name is allowed. But we the best explanation would be
platform setup code should provide the "best" or "default" compatible
property.

Right, thanks.
