In the currently implementation there's no difference since in case 2 and 3
OS will declare no ASPM support.

But with this patch, case 2 will have some differences.

[without this patch]
- os won't declare the support of ASPM in the dmesg
- os won't have ASPM control as well as other services

[with this patch]
- os will declare the support of ASPM in the dmesg
- os may get the ASPM control but won't actually enable it

Yes it's the initial purpose of this patch. The control of pcie_aspm=off
implicitly influence other services which have no explicit dependence on
ASPM.

Are we back to the initial approach [1] or something like that? If so, we're
going to declare no ASPM support and then firmware will have a chance to have
it. We'll have native hotplug but ASPM maybe controlled by the firmware.
This may violate the spec, per the PCI Firmware spec, r3.3, sec 4.5.3 as we
discussed previously [2]:

  // Only allow native hot plug control if the OS supports:
  // * ASPM
  // * Clock PM
  // * MSI/MSI-X

But with the approach in this patch we won't have this violation.
