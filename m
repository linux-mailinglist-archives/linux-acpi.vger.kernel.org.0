If D3C isn't essential to seeing this problem, you could just omit it
altogether.  I think stripping out anything that's not essential will
make it easier to think about the underlying issues.

Yeah, interesting.  It was definitely a much larger patch.  I don't
know enough to comment on the races.  I would wonder whether there's a
way to get rid of the caches that become stale, but that's just an
idle thought, not a suggestion.
