Yes just iterating over the CDAT entries and directly calling the
appropriate parser function for the entry seems more straightforward.

I think this is backwards.  I'd suggest creating a struct for each
CDAT entry which includes the header.  The kernel switched to
-std=gnu11 a while ago, so you should be able to use an unnamed field
for the header:

struct cdat_dsmas {
	struct cdat_entry_header;
	u8 dsmad_handle;
	u8 flags;
	u8 reserved[2];
	__le64 dpa_base;
	__le64 dpa_length;
}

Note that in my commit "cxl/pci: Handle truncated CDAT entries",
I'm only verifying that the number of bytes received via DOE
matches the length field in the cdat_entry_header.  I do not
verify in cxl_cdat_read_table() whether that length is correct
for the specific CDAT structure.  I think that's the job of
the function parsing that particular structure type.

In other words, at the top of your DSMAS parsing function,
you need to check:

	struct cdat_dsmas dsmas;

	if (dsmas->length != sizeof(*dsmas)) {
		dev_err(...);
		return -EINVAL;
	}


Note how the check is simplified by the header being part of
struct cdat_dsmas.  If the header wasn't part of struct cdat_dsmas,
an addition would be needed here.

Thanks,

Lukas
