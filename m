Considering the investigative side ("why won't the _CID match?") and
most the commit message were Alex's, and that those things comprise
95% of what this patch is, and that the code change itself isn't even
part of anything Turing complete, I most certainly did not feel
comfortable stripping Alex's authorship. Instead I added myself as a
co-author at the bottom. When in doubt, err on the side of crediting
others. Alex also took a look at this patch, I am under the impression
of at least, before it went out. Let's minimize the paperwork
policing, okay? I think it'd make for a much more pleasant space here.
If Alex objects he can just simply say, "hey feel free to remove me as
author," and it'll be simple as that, and again doesn't involve your
policing.

Good point for strengthening the argument here. Will do.

I actually looked at every usage in the tree (there aren't that many)
and couldn't find a single one where behavior changed, performance
changed, or memory usage changed. I thought we looked together on IRC
so I'm surprised to see you mention this, but maybe I misunderstood
you. Anyway, I can't see the size increase impacting anything at all.
If you see a case, this would be the time to mention that you see
something. I didn't find anything though.

I'm not sure there really were other usages back then. The commit
message seems descriptive enough to me too. This was about cross
compiling, so padding. But it certainly did seem to limit future
drivers in an unintended way, as you wrote:

Right, that's the idea.

Thanks.

Hopefully we'll hear from Rafael this week.
