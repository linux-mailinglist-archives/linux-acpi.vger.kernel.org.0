It sounded like Bjorn needed more convincing:

    "I don't know how hard we should work to protect against that."

...and I'm advocating that yes, DOE config-writes are in a different
class than other critical register writes, and that class is analogous
to what Linux does for driver managed MMIO exclusion.

No, that does not sound right. My reading of the PCI IDE spec
highlights a few exclusions that apply here:

1/ A DOE instance that implements the CMA/SPDM protocol will support
"no other data object protocol(s)".

2/ An SPDM session once established arranges for "requests that are
received through a different secure [SPDM] session must be discarded
by the Responder, and must not result in a response"

Linux has the mitigation for that situation defined already. It's the
mechanism for /dev/mem and pci-mmap exclusion: disable the driver to
enable unfettered userspace access (modulo kernel-lockdown is
disabled).

Right, ephemeral per-transaction lockout is more complicated to handle
than coarse lockout bounded to driver attach lifetime.

Agree, and Linux has historically tried to wrap specific protocols
around capabilities like this rather than defining raw passthroughs.
I.e. I'm equating DOE enabling policy to ACPI DSM enabling policy. So
per-protocol enabling is my expectation regardless of sysfs or ioctl.
In fact. for SPDM and IDE key establishment that is probably neither
ioctl nor sysfs, but instead a cooperation with the Linux keys api.

No major disagreement on the big picture... just quibbling with
details at this point.
