Hmm, if add_device() ever did fail it should really be expected to 
return the device back to an un-added state, so I don't believe that 
particular concern should be significant regardless...

However, I am inclined to agree that it's probably better to make it all 
moot. Although it indeed should never happen, ISTR at the time there 
appeared to be some possible path somewhere by which the notifier may 
have been triggered a second time - possibly if some other device failed 
or deferred after the first call, triggering the bus code to start all 
over again. Since then, though, we've made a lot of changes to how 
->add_device usually gets called, plus stuff like the 
iommu_device_link() call has snuck in that might not stand up to a 
replay anyway, so I don't see any problem with making this condition a 
hard failure. It's certainly much easier to reason about.

In fact, there will already be a WARN from iommu_probe_device() now 
(because the first call will have set the group), so I don't think we 
need any additional diagnostic in the driver any more.

Robin.
