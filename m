AFAIK none of the host controllers requiring this IRQ muxing is shipped
with a firmware stack that can bootstrap them with ACPI.

That's why I think this patch is a thought exercise, there is not much
to talk about.

I did not say that to solve the INTX muxing we can use FW. I said that
to probe the host controllers that require this muxing there must be
firmware in place (to allow probing them with ACPI) before we look at
solving the PCI INTX muxing issue.

We should not solve issues that don't exist ;-)
