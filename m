Since we're trying to avoid an issue on AMD systems, I would
definitely prefer to have the code change mention AMD instead of
Intel.

This is a tangent; I was just trying to make the point that the date
check means a BIOS update may change Linux behavior even if the update
has nothing to do with PM, and I think that's a bad thing even if the
new behavior is not a failure.  But this is water under the bridge and
is probably not going to cause problems in the future.

Thanks for this, that helps.  If pci_bridge_d3_possible() is a list of
quirks for systems that are known to be broken (or at least not known
to work correctly and avoiding D3 is acceptable), then we should
document and use it that way.

The current documentation ("checks if it is possible to move to D3")
frames it as "does the bridge have the required features?" instead of
"do we know about something broken in this bridge or this platform?"

If something is broken, I would expect tests based on the device or
DMI check.  But several some are not obvious defects.  E.g.,
"bridge->is_hotplug_bridge && !pciehp_is_native(bridge)" -- what
defect are we finding there?  What does the spec require that isn't
happening?

In this particular patch, apparently we assume any non-Intel port or
any BIOS before 2015 is broken.  Obviously way too general.  We know
"USB keyboards don't wake from suspend," but I think we need something
at the PCI level like "PME interrupt doesn't happen when bridge is in
state X" (i.e., the part that is non-compliant), and "one consequence
is that downstream devices can't wake from suspend."

If this is basically quirks and we treat it that way (comments about
the breakage and references to what the spec violations are), maybe
this is the best we can do.
