From: "Rafael J. Wysocki" <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

The ACPI OS layer in Linux uses RCU to protect the list of ACPI
memory mappings from being walked while it is being updated.  Among
other situations, that list can be walked in (NMI and non-NMI)
interrupt context, so using a sleeping lock to protect it is not
an option.

However, performance issues related to the RCU usage in there
appear, as described by Dan Williams:

"Recently a performance problem was reported for a process invoking
a non-trival ASL program. The method call in this case ends up
repetitively triggering a call path like:

    acpi_ex_store
    acpi_ex_store_object_to_node
    acpi_ex_write_data_to_field
    acpi_ex_insert_into_field
    acpi_ex_write_with_update_rule
    acpi_ex_field_datum_io
    acpi_ex_access_region
    acpi_ev_address_space_dispatch
    acpi_ex_system_memory_space_handler
    acpi_os_map_cleanup.part.14
    _synchronize_rcu_expedited.constprop.89
    schedule

The end result of frequent synchronize_rcu_expedited() invocation is
tiny sub-millisecond spurts of execution where the scheduler freely
migrates this apparently sleepy task. The overhead of frequent
scheduler invocation multiplies the execution time by a factor
of 2-3X."

The source of this is that acpi_ex_system_memory_space_handler()
unmaps the memory mapping currently cached by it at the access time
it that mapping doesn't cover the memory area being accessed.
Consequently, if there is a memory opregion with two fields
separated from each other by an unused chunk of address space that
is large enough for not being covered by a single mapping, and they
happen to be used in an alternating pattern, the unmapping will
occur on every acpi_ex_system_memory_space_handler() invocation for
that memory opregion and that will lead to significant overhead.

To remedy that, modify acpi_ex_system_memory_space_handler() so it
can defer the unmapping of the memory mapped by it till it is
deactivated if a special ACPI_OS_MAP_MEMORY_FAST_PATH() macro,
allowing its users to get an extra reference to a known-existing
memory mapping without actually mapping it again, is defined in the
OS layer.

Namely, make acpi_ex_system_memory_space_handler() manage an internal
list of memory mappings covering all memory accesses through it that
have occurred so far if ACPI_OS_MAP_MEMORY_FAST_PATH() is present, so
that every new mapping is added to that list with an extra reference
obtained via ACPI_OS_MAP_MEMORY_FAST_PATH() which prevents it from
being unmapped by acpi_ex_system_memory_space_handler() itself.
Of course, those mappings need to go away at one point, so change
acpi_ev_system_memory_region_setup() to unmap them when the memory
opregion holding them is deactivated.

This should reduce the acpi_ex_system_memory_space_handler() overhead
for memory opregions that do not appear and then go away immediately
after a single access.  [of course, ACPI_OS_MAP_MEMORY_FAST_PATH()
needs to be implemented by the OS for this change to take effect.]
