Sounds like there may be a requirement in a Thunderbolt spec about
this, so maybe we could add that citation?  I guess this goes with the
"bridge->is_thunderbolt" check?

And I guess this goes with the "System Management Mode" and
"Thunderbolt on non-Macs" comments?  A citation to the source behind
"OS shall not put the hotplug port in D3 behind firmware's back" would
be super helpful here.

Thanks!  I think it would be worth trying to separate out the "normal"
things that correspond to the spec from the "quirk" things that work
around defects.  That's not material for *this* patch, though.

It's also a little weird that pci_bridge_d3_possible() itself looks
like it's invariant for the life of the system, but we call it several
times (pci_pm_init(), pci_bridge_d3_update(), pcie_portdrv_probe(),
etc).  I guess this is because we save the result in dev->bridge_d3,
but then pci_bridge_d3_update() updates dev->bridge_d3 based on other
things, so the original value is lost.  Maybe another bit or two could
avoid those extra calls.
