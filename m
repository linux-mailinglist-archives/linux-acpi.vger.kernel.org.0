Are you means that the acpi_fwnode_device_get_match_data() implementation?
As the fwnode API framework has three backend: OF, ACPI, and software node.
If you are hinting me that the acpi backend has the .device_get_match_data
implemented. Then you are right.


> Second, there *is* DT support for the _selected_ x86 based platforms.

Yeah, you maybe right again here. I guess you means that some special
hardware or platform may have a *limited* support?

Can you pointed it out for study of learning purpose?

To speak precisely, there are some drm display bridges drivers are
lack of the DT support on X86. Those display bridges belong to the
device drivers catalogs.

OK, I will update my commit message at the next version if possible,
and try my best to describe the problem precisely.

OK, thanks a lot.

It can be inside the chip, there is no clear cut.  I means that
the graph(including fwnode graph, OF graph or swnode graph) can
be used at anywhere. The examples given here may lead you to
think it is board specific, but it is not limited to board specific.

fwnode graph, OF graph and swnode graph, all of them are implements
of the graph. Its common that different hardware vendors bought the
some IP and has been integrated it into their SoC. So it can be inside
of the chip if you want *code sharing*.


Back to the patch itself, we want to keep the three backends aligned as 
much as possible. Is this reasonable enough?

I really didn't have seen that thread before this patch is sent,
I'm a graphic developer, I'm mainly focus on graphics domain.

Previously, I have implemented similar functionality at the drivers
layer [1][2]. But as the instances grows,  I realized there is a
risk to introducing *boilerplate*.  So I send this patch. [1][2] can
be drop if this patch could be merged.

[1] https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/575414/?series=129040&rev=1

[2] https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/575411/?series=129040&rev=1


After a brief skim,  I guess we encounter similar problems. Oops!
In a nutshell, there is a need to *emulation* on X86 platform,
to suit the need of device-driver coding style of DT world.

Besides, at the swnode backend layer, we should not call
fwnode_property_read_string(), instead, we should usethe property_entry_read_string_array() function. Because the 
fwnode_property_read_string() is belong to upper layer.
While backend implementations should call functions from
bottom layer only.
