Aren't there quite a few reasons why device_add() might fail?  (Although 
most of them probably are memory allocation errors...)

Basically, you have to make up your mind.  If a function can fail, you 
should be prepared to handle the failure.  If it can't fail, there's no 
point in even checking the return code.
