Thanks for the update.  It's a real hassle to debug issues in this
code, especially when it's a long repro cycle like this.  I always
wish we could feed the initial config (which I think we should already
know from existing dmesg logging) into some kind of qemu test fixture
so we could reproduce things locally.
