Looks similar to the PCI core warning here:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/pci/probe.c?id=v6.7#n1134

The comment says it doesn't work for devices on the root bus, though.
Maybe it could be made to work there as well?

That would definitely be a good thing.  I would like it if that were
more obvious from reading the code because I spend waaay too much time
staring at that labyrinth.

Yes, it has happened.  There's an example in the commit log here:
https://git.kernel.org/linus/070909e56a7d ("x86/pci: Reserve ECAM if
BIOS didn't include it in PNP0C02 _CRS")

Yeah.  It's pretty hard to remove those options though.  For example,
"pci=routeirq" was added in the pre-git era and probably isn't
necessary, but how do we know nobody uses it?
