Please don't invent patch authors like that. Alex's patch that started
this discussion was completely different.

Please clarify that this applies to the module metadata side of
things. The ACPI subsystem already captures and exposes _HIDs and
_CIDs that are longer than 8 characters, which is why simply
increasing the size of this field is sufficient to create modules that
can match devices that expose a CID that is longer than 8 bytes.

The padding situation only applies to struct acpi_device_id, whereas
ACPI_ID_LEN is used in other places as well. Also, the size of vmlinux
only covers statically allocated instances in the core kernel, and
most of the ACPI_ID_LEN uses are probably in drivers. So whether
vmlinux changes size or not is not that relevant.

Patch 6543becf26ff was wrong to change ACPI_ID_LEN, because it failed
to take into account any other uses of ACPI_ID_LEN, and did not bother
to explain why the change was necessary in the context of what it was
trying to achieve.

So, given that we need more than 8 characters to match drivers to
devices exposed by Hyper-V (or other VMMs adhering to the VMGENID
spec), I think this change is necessary and correct.

So, with the authorship/signoff corrected, and the commit log clarified,
