I think I'd drop it for now - feels like a topic that needs more discussion.

Also, dumping this data to the kernel log isn't exactly elegant - particularly
if we dump a lot more of it.  Perhaps tracepoints?

I guess it may depend on timing of this.  Personally I think 5.12 may be too aggressive.

As long as Bjorn can take a DVSEC deduplication as an immutable branch then perhaps
during 5.13 this tree can sit on top of that.
