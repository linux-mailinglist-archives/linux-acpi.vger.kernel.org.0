in the switch, rather than that odd OF behavior]

I can't follow you here. Please note, that you need the actual
physical port number. It's not a made up number, but corresponds
to a physical port on that ethernet switch. So you can't just skip
the disabled ones. port@2 must have port number 2.

See above, it is not just an iterator but corresponds to
a hardware property.

Horatiu, can we determine the actual number of ports (or maybe
determine if its a LAN9668 or a LAN9662) from the hardware itself
in an easy way? That way we wouldn't need a new compatible string,
but could use the generic "lan966x" one.
