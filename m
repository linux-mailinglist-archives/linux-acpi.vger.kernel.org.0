Hi Rafael,

True! I'll push a v3 with this change tomorrow, after I rebase and
re-test on 5.17-rc6.

I've not checked for guaranteed performance as according to the
specification it's optional and it's designed to be between lowest_perf and
nominal_perf. If guaranteed performance is/will be used anywhere, it should
have its own validation against lower/nominal/highest.

Therefore I think checking that we have a highest_perf value higher or equal
to both nominal_perf and lowest_perf is the right balance in validation.

Yes, there are no perfect solutions, and whether one exposes nominal or
highest performance there will be consequences. But I think the task
scheduler has progressed to cope better with unavailable capacity.

For example, after the PELT changes at [1], CPUs won't seem underutilized
if they are always running, even if they are not running at the highest
frequency. Before these changes to PELT, the utilization of a CPU was
capped to the current capacity of the CPU. So in that case, if the
nominal_perf was 70% of highest_perf and the CPU was only running at
nominal_freq, its utilization could not exceed 716 (big CPU). But after
[1] if the CPU had no idle time, it does exceed 716 and could be marked
as overutilized. That utilization doesn't really have a meaning (we
don't know how utilized the CPU would have been if it would have run at
boosted frequencies) but it does not have to, as long as it signals the
need of an action: migrate tasks to another CPU, possibly disable EAS.

Guaranteed performance is a tricky one:
"
Guaranteed Performance Register conveys to OSPM a Guaranteed Performance
level, which is the current maximum sustained performance level of a
processor, taking into account all known external constraints (power
budgeting, thermal constraints, AC vs DC power source, etc.). All
processors are expected to be able to sustain their guaranteed
performance levels simultaneously. The guaranteed performance level is
required to fall in the range [Lowest Performance, Nominal performance],
inclusive.
"

In my experience everyone interprets this differently and therefore
platform providers could populate this vastly differently. One could
argue that the only true guaranteed performance is the lowest
performance as it's the only one potentially sustainable under any power
and especially thermal conditions. As well one could argue that it could
be closer or equal to nominal performance, but that is the case only if
one considers thermal effects unlikely. Therefore it may be that it's
highly unreliable as a generic source of capacity information.


Therefore, I'm still leaning towards keeping the use of highest_perf in
this case due to the scheduler's ability to cope with unavailable
capacity but also because it reflects better u-arch differences between
CPUs.

Thank you,
Ionela.
