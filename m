That's where I'm failing to understand: CPER is part of UEFI spec, and
the only deliverable mechanism I'm aware of for CPER is via GHES or
GHESv2 - e.g. via ACPI.

Within the scope of https://uefi.org/specifications, I'm failing
to see any other deliverable mechanism.

The logic is related to GHES, as this seems to be the only standardized
mechanism to report CPER records. As it is part of APEI, get_maintainers
points to the people that have been maintaining it as:

	$ ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl -f ./drivers/acpi/apei/ghes.c
	"Rafael J. Wysocki" <rafael@kernel.org> (maintainer:ACPI APEI,commit_signe=

	linux-acpi@vger.kernel.org (open list:ACPI APEI)
	linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org (open list)

Moving it elsewhere would make it confusing, as the expected deliverable
mechanism for CPER is via GHES - as this is the only one defined at the
uefi.org specs.

While it might be moved to EFI and placed under cper.c,=20
get_maintainers.pl would point to:

	$ ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl -f ./drivers/firmware/efi/cper.c
	Ard Biesheuvel <ardb@kernel.org> (maintainer:EXTENSIBLE FIRMWARE INTERFACE=
 (EFI))
	linux-efi@vger.kernel.org (open list:EXTENSIBLE FIRMWARE INTERFACE (EFI))
	linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org (open list)

which is not the people that have been maintaining RAS.

Placing it under a "estatus.c" file would make it completely
dissociated with UEFI/ACPI specs, as this name means nothing at
the specs.

Also, adding a new maintainer's entry won't make any sense, as the
people that currently reviews and maintains GHES/CPER records
should be kept.

As Boris mentioned on patch 00/12, we need to better understand
the high level scenario, as it is still not clear to me how a
firmware-first notification would happen without ACPI.
