Right, but we're doing using device_attach() largely because the
driver core doesn't provide any mechanism for deferring the initial
probe. I didn't think there was any deeper reason for it, but while
looking I noticed that the initial probe can be async and
device_attach() forces probing to be synchronous. That has the side
effect of serialising all PCI device probing which might be
intentional to avoid device renaming due to the change in probe order.
Userspace is better at dealing with device names changing now days,
but you might still get some people mad at you for changing it.

Huh, that's pretty weird. Even with that hack you should be able
trigger the bug they're working around by removing the IOMMU device in
sysfs and doing a rescan. I wouldn't worry much about making
match_device user controllable since you would need to work pretty
hard for it to be an issue.
