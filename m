I'm not aware of one, but I don't have access to every bit of HW either.

Well the original version was simpler, but I tend to agree with Ionela 
who proposed this version in a previous review. The module param at this 
point is a debugging/testing statment since it allows the user to force 
FIE on or off independent of the PCC decision. Until we have a clear 
statment about how/when/where this feature is useful, having the ability 
to make the choice dynamically at runtime is quite useful and less 
intrusive than having multiple kernels/modules on the machine with the 
config option flipped, and requiring a reboot.

I think with this patch applied we aren't any worse than before, but 
that is based on the fact that I've not seen a machine that has actual 
CPPC hardware registers (rather than mailboxes).

So I think your suggesting that we will then have to revisit the code 
(to maybe avoid all the cppc_fie task/etc overhead) if a machine appears 
with hardware registers. And I tend to sorta agree, but that is what the 
second patch is for :) which will likely be what most distro's end up 
applying on generic kernels.

Your average user will never turn this knob, and if they do, its likely 
to solve a problem, or test for performace. The fact that we aren't 100% 
sure of where/when this feature is useful is the argument for making it 
a tunable.

I don't really have an opinion about this, maybe someone else can 
comment :)

Although, with both of these patches applied we can kick the decision 
down the road and revisit it in a couple years, and maybe have a clearer 
view.
