A quick diff of drivers/base/core.c between driver-core-testing and my
local tree doesn't show any major diff (only some unrelated comment
fixes). So, it looks fine.

The patch 13 conflict is probably due to having to rebase the v2
series on top of this:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20201104205431.3795207-1-saravanak@google.com/

And looks like Patch 16 was handled fine.

Thanks for applying the series.
