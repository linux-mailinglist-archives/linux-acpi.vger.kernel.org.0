Mh. Assume a SoC with an integrated ethernet switch. Some ports
are externally connected, some don't. I'd think they should be disabled,
no? Until now, all bindings I know, treat them as disabled. But OTOH
you still need to do some configurations on them, like disable port
forwarding, disable them or whatever. So the hardware is present, but
it is not connected to anything.

Case 1 is invalid I think.

How does case 2 break the binding? It breaks the driver, yes. But not
the binding. I agree on the out-of-tree argument, *but* isn't that
what the binding is for, that out-of-tree device trees gonna work as
long as they follow the binding? And I don't see where it dictates that 
all
nodes must be enabled; nor that it must either be 2 or 8 children nodes.

Mh. Rob was always in favor of dedicated compatible strings. And I
think there are also subtle differences. Eg. the LAN9662 has some kind
of accelerating engine, if I'm not mistaken.

So what do you prefer:

   compatible = "microchip,lan9668";
and
   compatible = "microchip,lan9662";

or

   compatible = "microchip,lan966x";
   microchip,num-phys-ports = <8>;
and
   compatible = "microchip,lan966x";
   microchip,num-phys-ports = <2>;
   microchip,accelerating-engine;
   ..

The argument here was always, we don't want too much properties if
it can be deduced by the compatible string.

I'd argue, that is the usual case for all the switch bindings I
know of; not some unusual config. E.g. the SoC dtsi disables all
ports by default and only the ones which are actually connected
by the board are then enabled in the board dts, see
arch/arm/boot/dts/lan966x.dtsi
arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/fsl-ls1028a.dtsi

That being said, I don't care too much about the older kernels.
So I'm fine with (3).
