It's possible that many quirks will be required.  But I think in the
long run the value of the simplest, most obvious strategy is huge.
It's laid out in the spec already and it's the clearest way to
agreement between firmware and OS.  When we trip over something, it's
very easy to determine whether _CRS is wrong or Linux is using it
wrong.  If we have to bring in question of looking at E820 entries,
possibly merging them, using them or not based on overlaps ... that's
a much more difficult conversation without a clear resolution.

Yes.  It's ugly but I think the 10-year outlook is better.

Yes, it might.  But I'm not 100% comfortable because it basically
sweeps _CRS bugs under the rug, and we may trip over them as we do
more hotplug and (eventually) resource rebalancing.  I think we need
to work toward getting _CRS more reliable.
