Hi Sunil!

I'm trying to decipher this thread, so apologies in advance for the
stupid questions! :-P

AFAIU, the -EPROBE_DEFER changes are needed for GSIs (and the way the
IMSIC/APLIC irqchip series is structured), right?

There's a couple of separate pieces in play here:
1. IMSIC-IPI (MADT init)
2. IMSIC-MSI (MADT init, imsic_platform_acpi_probe() patch 14)
3. APLIC-wired (platform)
4. APLIC-MSI-bridge (platform)

APLIC-MSI-bridge is pretty much a RISC-V mbigen.

Some devices do not have ResourceSource parsing implemented yet. The PNP
devices that cannot use ResourceSource (you mention PNP0501 (16550) and
PNP0C0F (PCI interrupt link devices), do we really need to care about
them for the RISC-V platforms using ACPI? If that would change, the
kernel drivers can be adjusted (d44fa3d46079 ("ACPI: Add support for
ResourceSource/IRQ domain mapping"))?

I guess my question is we need to care about GSIs w/o explicit
ResourceSource, so that APLIC-MSI-bridge can be used.

GED works nicely with ResourceSource, and covers a lot of the GSI
use-cases, no?

And if we do care, then *both* 3 and 4 would need at MADT scan
point/init, and not be a platform device (late init).

From my, probably naive perspective, it's a bit weird *not* to create
the irq domains at MADT scan time.

Again is this only for GSIs? Patch 14 moves the IMSIC-MSI init to MADT
for PCIe devices (which is different from DT), so it's not for PCIe
devices. I wonder if it's a lot of churn for something that will not be
used for RISC-V ACPI systems...

A quick look at what Arm's GICv3 does, all irq domains are created at
MADT init.
