IIUC, mapping a GSI to an IO-APIC pin requires information from the
MADT.  So I guess Xen does use the static ACPI tables, but not the AML
_PRT methods that would connect a GSI with a PCI device?

I guess this means Xen would not be able to deal with _MAT methods,
which also contains MADT entries?  I don't know the implications of
this -- maybe it means Xen might not be able to use with hot-added
devices?

The tables (including DSDT and SSDTS that contain the AML) are exposed
to userspace via /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/, but of course that
doesn't mean Xen knows how to interpret the AML, and even if it did,
Xen probably wouldn't be able to *evaluate* it since that could
conflict with the host kernel's use of AML.
