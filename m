Good question.

Whilst I agree it is unlikely to turn up as a conventional vendor-id
(though I've not found any text ruling it out) it already turns up
in locations other than DOE.

Many of them aren't software visible, but potentially places
like SPDM are in which you would have a registry ID of 0x3 (PCI-SIG)
followed by the PCI vendor ID (this one).  Those are used in SPDM
vendor defined requests / responses.

That SPDM feature is then used in IDE establishment.
The IDE ECN (via pcisig.com) has the following:
"The VendorID field of the VENDOR_DEFINED_REQUEST/
 VENDOR_DEFINED_RESPONSE must contain the value 0001h, which is assigned to
 the PCI-SIG."

Which to my reading, isn't quite the same as saying it's a vendor ID,
but nearly so.

Now, I argued the *_DVSEC_* naming in the CXL one based on the spec saying
that was all it could be used for but I may well have been wrong longer
term.

I'm fine with renaming it to the PCI_DOE_* version then dropping the DOE
when it gets used for something else though if that works for people.

At least this time naming isn't made awkward by legalese.
