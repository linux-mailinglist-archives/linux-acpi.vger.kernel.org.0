Have you considered renaming "fw_devlink" to "fwnode_link"?

That would be much less confusing IMO and the name of this function
would be clearer.

"... between consumer device @con and the supplier device represented
by @sup" (and see below).

I'd call the second arg sup_handle to indicate that it is not a struct device.

I would do

if (sup_dev) {
        if (!device_link_add(con, sup_dev, flags))
                ret = -EINVAL;

        put_device(sup_dev);
        return ret;
}

here and the cycle detection (error code path) below, possibly using
the same dev pointer.
