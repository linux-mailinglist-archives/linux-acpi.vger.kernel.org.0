Yes.  I don't completely understand this bit, but I think it's related
to the fact that L0s support was originally required for all links, so
the only defined ASPM Support encodings were these:

  01b - L0s supported
  11b - L0s and L1 supported

The "ASPM Optionality" ECN [1] of June 19, 2009, added these new
encodings:

  00b - No ASPM support
  10b - L1 supported

So I think the _OSC "ASPM Optionality Supported" bit tells the
firmware that the OS supports this new possibility of devices that
support L1 but not L0s.

Linux currently never sets the "ASPM Optionality Supported" bit, but
it probably should, because I think we *do* support L1 even if L0s
isn't supported.

I think you're saying that firmware could not tell the difference, but
the Linux log messages might be slightly misleading.  I assume you
mean this message:

  acpi PNP0A08:00: _OSC: OS supports [ExtendedConfig ASPM ClockPM Segments MSI EDR HPX-Type3]

where we would claim that we support ASPM even when CONFIG_PCIEASPM is
unset.

The purpose of that message is to expose what Linux is telling the
platform via _OSC.  If we're telling the platform we support ASPM, I
think the message should reflect that.

But I'm actually not sure there's real value in advertising ASPM
support to the platform when CONFIG_PCIEASPM=y but we're booted with
"pcie_aspm=off".  It sounds like this was found by using that option
(even though it wasn't *needed*) and finding that Linux didn't request
control of other PCIe services.  I don't know if that's worth
changing.
