So I think this is a good compromise for now. However, the point of this taint
was that it is specifically called out what tainted the kernel. It'd be great to
know when we have a bug report it was this specifically that was the issue.
Rambling further I realize now that taint doesn't tell you which module tainted,
which would be great here. That's actually what I'd like.

End ramble.
