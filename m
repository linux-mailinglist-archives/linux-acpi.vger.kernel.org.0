Ah I was confused if that was a separate statement.

Can you specify the function prototype you're hoping for (or modification to the
structure)?

I really like the lowest level function to simply model the hardware. I get to
write the 8 steps out and clearly implement them.

I personally don't think it's so awkward, but again, give me something more
specific and I'll consider it.
