I suspect that there is a problem with the pm_suspend_via_firmware()
check which returns 'false' on the affected board, but the platform
actually removes power from devices left in D0 during suspend.

I guess it would be more appropriate to check something like
pm_suspend_no_platform() which would return 'true' in the
suspend-to-idle patch w/ ACPI.
