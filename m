What locking rules? 9 years ago when of_iommu_configure() was introduced 
(97890ba9289c), of_dma_configure() ran at device creation time, and that 
remains the case in some places, so cannot necessarily be called wrong. 
Subsequently making it run off driver probe in the general case was a 
bit of a hack, but at the time probe deferral was the only tool we had 
available to easily enforce the ordering of IOMMU drivers relative to 
client drivers. In hindsight there are subtleties which weren't really 
apparent at the time, but what *was* clear was that the benefit of 
letting IOMMU drivers be normal drivers without any special 
OF_IOMMU_DECLAREÂ£() weirdness was significant, and thus today's mess was 
unwittingly born.

The existing locking rules are that there aren't any locking rules 
(other than the probe_device_lock bodge), which obviously could be 
better, but does rather disprove the assertion that they could be 
violated. A robust locking scheme would be great, but designing one 
based on something which already violates *other* IOMMU API assumptions, 
such that a) it can't ever really work, and b) it makes those underlying 
issues even harder to fix, is not productive.

Thanks,
Robin.
