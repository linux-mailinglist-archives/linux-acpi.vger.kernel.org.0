If we do this, can we combine it with set_pcie_untrusted(), where we
already set pdev->untrusted?  Maybe that needs to be renamed; I don't
see anything PCIe-specific there, and it looks like it works for
conventional PCI as well.

I'm a bit hesitant about this, too.  It really doesn't have anything
in particular to do with the PCI core.  It's not part of the PCI
specs, and it could apply to any kind of device, not just PCI (ACPI,
platform, USB, etc).

We have:

  dev->removable                # struct device
  pdev->is_thunderbolt
  pdev->untrusted
  pdev->external_facing

and it feels a little hard to keep everything straight.  Most of them
are "discovered" based on some DT or ACPI firmware property.  None of
them really has anything specifically to do with *PCI*, and I don't
think the PCI core depends on any of them.  I think
pdev->is_thunderbolt is the only one we discover based on a PCI
feature (the Thunderbolt Capability), and the things we *use* it for
are actually not things specified by that capability [1].

Could drivers just look for these properties directly instead of
relying on the PCI core to get in the middle?  Most callers of
device_property_read_*() are in drivers.  I do see that doing it in
the PCI core might help enforce standard usage in DT/ACPI, but we
could probably do that in other ways, too.
