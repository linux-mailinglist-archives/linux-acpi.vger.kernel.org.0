Right looking at the dmesg output that one needs to be added to,
I've done that for the v9 which I'm preparing.

Yes that seems a good summary to me. Actually it is so good I'm going
to steal it for the commit msg of the split out date check patch :)

Ack.

Yes they should.

Ok, I'll go and prepare a v9 and I will submit that later today.
