Looking for input from ARM (Lorenzo?), X86(not sure) and ACPI(Rafael?) people
on this set. As it also touches NFIT handling perhaps someone who focuses on
that as well. Please feel free to CC additional people who might be interested.

I'm fairly confident that it should be uncontroversial (famous last words)
and it closes down a problem that lead to issues with seemingly obvious
changes in the past. (The whole PCI _PXM issue on some threadripper platforms).

Thanks to Bjorn, Hanjun and Barry for feedback on earlier revisions.

Thanks,

Jonathan
