Correct! I've fixed that comment in v4 [1].

I don't believe so because of:

"Platforms must use the same performance scale for all processors in the
system. On platforms with heterogeneous processors, the performance
characteristics of all processors may not be identical. In this case, the
platform must synthesize a performance scale that adjusts for differences
in processors, such that any two processors running the same workload at
the same performance level will complete in approximately the same time."

So IMO, given this description, it's not appropriate to provide/use
capacity-dmips-mhz "performance levels" in _CPC. To have a very simple
example, let's assume we have a system with two CPUs of the same u-arch
but one of them is clocked at 1GHz while the other is clocked at 2GHz
(fixed frequency for both). If we are to run a theoretical benchmark on
both we would get 50% on the first and 100% on the second (considering we
normalize the performance scores on a scale [0, 100%]). So we could have
50 and 100 as highest performance levels in _CPC, if one uses a system
wide performance scale as described in the specification.

But if we convert those values to DMIPS/MHz we would get the same value
for both CPUs. But if we provide this same value as highest performance
level in _CPC for both we break the rule of "running the same workload
at the same performance level will complete in approximately the same
time."

All frequency information on ACPI system is optional so even if one
would ever want to do something like the above, one might not know what
is the maximum frequency of a CPU. I believe the tendency in recent
systems (even DT based) is the opposite - to hide frequency information
(usually only known to firmware) and only work with abstract performance
scales. So likely in the future is the DT path that might change.
