I think you should drop the "By the way ..." text or move it after the
"---" at the bottom of your commit log.  It doesn't help understand
this patch.

This text also doesn't seem relevant to this patch.

I'm having a hard time figuring out the reason for this patch.

Apparently the relevant parts are sdei_init() and ghes_init().
Today they are executed in that order:

  subsys_initcall_sync(sdei_init);
  device_initcall(ghes_init);

After this patch, they would be executed in the same order, but called
explicitly instead of as initcalls:

  acpi_pci_root_init()
  {
    acpi_hest_init();
    sdei_init();
    ghes_init();
    ...

Explicit calls are certainly better than initcalls, but that doesn't
seem to be the reason for this patch.

Does this patch fix a bug?  If so, what is the bug?

You say that currently "errors that occur before GHES initialization
are missed".  Isn't that still true after this patch?  Does this patch
merely reduce the time before GHES initialization?  If so, I'm
dubious, because we have to tolerate an arbitrary amount of time
there.

s/acpi_tb_laod_namespace/acpi_tb_load_namespace/

You use "()" after function names sometimes, but not always.  Please
do it consistently.

What's the connection between PCI, SDEI, and GHES?  As far as I can
tell, SDEI and GHES are not PCI-specific, so it doesn't seem like they
should be initialized here in acpi_pci_root_init().
