Doesn't seem likely to be related.  Once configured, ASPM operates
without any software intervention.  But note that "pcie_aspm=off"
means the kernel doesn't touch ASPM configuration at all, and any
configuration done by firmware remains in effect.

You can tell whether ASPM has been enabled by firmware with "sudo
lspci -vv" before the problem occurs.

Not really.  By "powered down", I meant D3cold, where the main power
is removed.  Config space is readable in all other power states.

Oh, right, I forgot that you mentioned this before.

This part is important.  We don't want to spend a lot of time
debugging an issue that may have already been fixed upstream.
