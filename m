ok, right. So I thought that PNP0501 was a standard cid to describe 
16550-compat UART which may be on an LPC bus. And a LPC bus is 
non-discoverable, like SPI or I2C, which also use "enumerated by parent".

Indeed, using PNP0501 for hisi lpc UART cid would be without problem, 
apart from the fact that we can't do all the PIO translation (so need 
"enumerated by parent").

Thanks,
john
