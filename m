I've applied the patch from Yang Yingliang and I thought it would be
OK to add your ACK to it based on the conversation so far (please let
me know if that's not the case).  Next, I've added my patch rebased on
top of it with the tags from you and Greg.

The result is on my bleeding-edge branch:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm.git/log/?h=bleeding-edge

and these are the commits in question

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm.git/commit/?h=bleeding-edge&id=d674553009afc9b24cab2bbec71628609edbbb27
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm.git/commit/?h=bleeding-edge&id=54872fea6a5ac967ec2272aea525d1438ac6735a

Please let me know if you see any issues with them.

If not, I'll go ahead and move them to my linux-next branch.

Cheers!
