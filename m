There is no ability for userpsace to lock out the kernel, only kernel
locking out userspace.

Wait why isn't pci_cfg_access_lock() sufficient? The userspace DOE
transfer is halted, the kernel validates the state of DOE, does it's
work and releases the lock.

I'm not quite as enthusiastic about Greg's assertion that "we're
already broken why not allow more breakage" as he was also the one
supportive of /dev/mem restrictions in the face of obvious collisions.
I'll circle back and say as much to Greg. My mistake was not realizing
the write dependency in the protocol, so the pushback was warranted
that the kernel does not need to block out all access.

Given that /dev/mem is optionally disabled for userspace access
outside of kernel-lockdown scenarios, I think it is reasonable to have
the kernel disable config writes to a register block and the request
of a driver.

Consider that userspace can certainly trash the system by writing to
the BAR registers, for example, but a non-malicious userspace has no
reason to do that. Unfortunately DOE has some utility for a
non-malicious userspace to access so there is a rationale to figure
out a cooperation scheme.

If it simplifies the kernel implementation to assume single
kernel-initiator then I think that's more than enough reason to block
out userspace, and/or provide userspace a method to get into the
kernel's queue for service.
