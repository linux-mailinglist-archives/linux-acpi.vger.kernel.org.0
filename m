Why is this a problem in general?

There are cases in which struct A needs to be found given struct B
(like in the ACPI thermal case, when the driver needs to get to
trips[i] from its local data) and there are cases in which struct B
needs to be found given struct A (like when a driver's callback is
invoked and passed a trip pointer, so the driver needs to get to its
local data from it - arguably this is not the case right now, but I
suppose it will be the case in the future).

So what's wrong with it, technically?  What's broken by it?  Why does
it make the code more difficult to maintain?

Not really, for all drivers that have local trip data and need to get
to trips[i] from there and/or the other way around.

Yes, it is, because that's the most straightforward way to address the
use case at hand IMV.

The ACPI thermal driver needs to update trip point temperatures at
times.  For this purpose, it needs to get from its local trip data to
trip[i] somehow.

Creating a new trips[] array and handing it over to the core is not an
option, because it potentially breaks the thermal device binding to
the zone (in which trip indices are used, mind you).

So how exactly do you want the driver to do the above?

It could save a pointer to each trips[i] in its local data structures
before registering the zone, but then if the core reordered the trips,
those pointers would become stale.

So how?
