Hi Jean,

Sorry for the delay, I was out last week. Comments inline below.

I think there the proximity domain is more for each assigned device
than vIOMMU. vIOMMU in the guest can have assigned devices belong to
different pIOMMU and proximity domains. If the guest owns the first
level page tables (gIOVA or SVA), we want to make sure page tables are
allocated from the close proximity domain.

My understanding is virtio IOMMU supports both virtio devices and
assigned devices. we could care less about the former in terms of NUMA.

In ACPI, we have _PXM method to retrieve device proximity domain. I
don't know if there is something equivalent or a generic way to get
_PXM information. I think VMM also need to make sure when an assigned
device is used with vIOMMU, there are some memory is allocated from the
device's proximity domain.

Should we reinvent something for NUMA or use ACPI's SRAT, _PXM? I am
not sure how it is handled today in QEMU in terms of guest-host NUMA
proximity domain mapping.
