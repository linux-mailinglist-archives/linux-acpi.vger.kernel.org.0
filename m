Hi Besar, Rafael,

Sorry for the delayed response.

Hi Besar,

This patch on its own looks fine and happy to ack. However I would like
to know general process on such changes that add platform or any bus
device but the driver itself is not upstream.

Any particular reason why you would like to rush and push this without
the actual driver to probe the device being added here ?

I really don't prefer this name:
1. arm-coresight-pmu is much better than "csite". I see the short form
   used elsewhere in the kernel is just "cs" as in cs_etm,...etc
2. Since APMT is more generic than just coresight(I understand coresight
   was the initial motivation for the generic specification) and also
   the type list seem to cover memory controller, SMMU,..etc, does
   it make sense to call it "arm-generic-pmu" or something similar.

Anyways, it can be part of the driver discussion as people might have
opinion based on what and how the driver covers the variety of PMU
types possible as described in APMT.

Not sure if the same device name will be re-used or PMUs can be registered
with different name under perf subsystem, but the name matters for the user
space tools and decoders. They may use the name or type information to analyse
the data samples.

So it is better to wait for all those discussion as part of the driver
upstreaming before you use this device name unless we are absolutely sure
the PMUs can be registered with different names in the driver(which could
be possible, I just don't know)

Apart from this name, I am OK with the changes here and happy to ack if it
is OK to merge this without any driver to probe this device yet.
