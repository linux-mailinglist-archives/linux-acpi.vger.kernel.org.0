The sharing of power resources is covered already.  That's not the problem here.

The missing part is the runtime resume of dependent devices and I'm not even sure
if it needs to be done in general or for PCI devices only.  At least it doesn't need to be
done for devices that are not configured for wakeup, even on a PCI bus.
