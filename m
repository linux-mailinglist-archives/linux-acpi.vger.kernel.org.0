I'm not sure what you mean by Hardware Reduced ACPI platform, but you
seem to be implying that in this case your hardware lacks RCECs and so
are using firmware specific handling.

In 1.3.2.3 (Root Complex Integrated Endpoint rules)

If an RCiEP is associated with an optional Root Complex Event Collector
it must signal PME and error conditions through a Root Complex Event
Collector.

If the RCEC is not supported/present then the expectation prior to PCIe
5 is that the RCiEP will use the same mechanism as PCI
systems.  However, if the RCiEP asserts say an error signal there is no
Root Port and the OS has no way of knowing what interrupt the error is
conntected to.  Linux doesn't have support for that and this was
discussed prior here:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190709134538.GA35486@google.com/

In such a case, are you then implying that the _OSC method is not
granting control of PCIe Native Power Management Events to the OS and
so are falling back to your defined ACPI mechanism on your platform?

I'm currently working on adding support for RCECs in AER that would
make use of the extended capabilities for identifying the assocated
RCeIPs for purposes of the PME and error condition signaling.

Thanks,

Sean
