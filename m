Sorry, Ard, and thanks for taking a look at this patch.

The user of this definitions is an ACPI device driver, named Platform Firmware
Runtime Update driver. This driver is designed to do firmware update via SMI.
This driver will do sanity check of the capsule file using these structures before
the file is passed to SMI. We put this check in kernel space rather than leaving
it to SMI because the latter is very costly.

The series patch is at:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-acpi/list/?series=543211
and the user is mainly PATCH 3/5:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-acpi/patch/9b2bd7d1e40633ce6f4845fb5c9e30a3faad5e7a.1631025237.git.yu.c.chen@intel.com/
in valid_version().

thanks,
Chenyu
