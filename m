I fully agree that we should learn from this and make sure that future
chips move closer towards SBSA compatibility so that these kinds of
quirks will not need to be added indefinitely.

However, there's always going to be transition periods where chips are
not as compliant as we want them to be. This can be timing related, as
well as target related. For example, Tegra194 was designed while the
details of the SBSA were still being worked out, so it can't be expected
to be fully compliant. At the same time, Tegra194 is not a server chip,
so even if SBSA had been finalized prior to its design, compliance may
not have been a consideration.

I guess this wouldn't have been much of an issue if circumstances hadn't
changed in the past few years and users didn't start to want ACPI even
on non-server systems.

But that's impossible. A CD released years ago wouldn't have had any of
the drivers to enable hardware support for hardware that didn't exist at
the time.

I suspect that you may even be able to boot an old kernel on a Tegra194
with ACPI support and everything that has a standard driver may work.
However, there's a lot of hardware for which standard ACPI drivers
simply don't exist, so there's always going to be code that needs to be
upstreamed in order to fully make use of new hardware.
