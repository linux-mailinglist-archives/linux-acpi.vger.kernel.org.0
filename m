Lifetime element of the DOE could be avoided by simply having

pcie_doe_register_all()
and
pcie_doe_unregister_all()

and so managing all DOE instances in one unit.

I'm not sure I like it, but certainly makes things simple.
After pcie_doe_register_all() call, all DOEs are ready to use
and we can have simple pcie_doe_find() to get one with
appropriate protocols.  There is never any need to specifically
release it because they are all cleaned up together in remove
/release path.

I'll put this together for a v2 and we can see how it shapes
up.
