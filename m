Well spotted.

I suppose that when the only function to get the next (available) child was
added, the expection was perhaps that only available child nodes did matter
in this API. On ACPI the two are almost always the same thing --- the
property API originates from OF and ACPI primarily uses different means to
work with what's under the level of devices.

What I'd perhaps do is to change the OF behaviour and switch callers to use
a different variant for drivers that do not appear solely ACPI-oriented.

acpi_fwnode_device_is_available() should return true for data nodes.
Otherwise getting the next available child isn't meaningful at all --- and
property API is primarily dealing with data nodes when it comes to ACPI.

I might not still try to backport the fixes as it matters more from API
consistency point of view than being an actual problem _right now_.

Also cc Heikki.
