But I guess Xen knows how to interpret a GSI even though it doesn't
have access to AML?

AFAIK Linux doesn't expose GSIs directly to userspace yet.  The GSI
concept relies on ACPI MADT, _MAT, _PRT, etc.  A GSI is associated
with some device (PCI in this case) and some interrupt controller
entry.  I don't understand how a GSI value is useful without knowing
something about that framework in which GSIs exist.

Obviously I know less than nothing about Xen, so I apologize for
asking all these stupid questions, but it just doesn't all make sense
to me yet.
