So it turns out we indeed have the same issue with MSIs since Tegra194
uses the same DesignWare controller that others do (looks like at least
HiSilicon and Annapurna Labs are in the same boat). That said, most
drivers fallback to legacy interrupts and that works fine. Agreed that
it isn't ideal, but it's about as good as it's going to get on this
hardware.

Yeah, I'd like to hear Bjorn's opinion on this. I understand that this
is far from an ideal situation and I'd much prefer that this chip was
compliant. But for historical reasons it isn't. This chip was designed
before SBSA became the quasi standard. Tegra194 also isn't a server
chip to begin with, so SBSA compliance would likely not have been the
main objective.

I read what you wrote. My point is that even "eventually" things are

I already said that we reported these findings to the hardware team and
this is hopefully going to allow us to be SBSA compliant in future
chips. However, it's too late for Tegra194 and we can't retroactively
fix it.

Customers have requested it and they want to be able to use an upstream

=46rom a maintenance point of view things aren't going to change much just
because we add these additional quirks. These are for the same IP that's
already supported by other quirks for other platforms and the code lives
entirely in the DesignWare driver, so I don't see how this negatively
impacts maintainability of the kernel.

Like I said, not much we can do about MSI support without more driver-
specific code. But since we can fallback to legacy interrupts, things
end up working fine.

Again, I fully realize that this isn't ideal and I'd rather prefer we
didn't have to add this. But I'm also realistic and understand that
hardware designs aren't always perfect, no matter how much we want them
to be. The best we can do is take the lessons learned and try to make
the next chip better.

Like I said, Tegra194 is not a server chip. But it turns out that people
want to use ACPI on non-server systems as well. The website that you
linked to above:

	https://developer.arm.com/architectures/platform-design/server-systems

even says that SBSA is being extended to other segments. So, again, this
means that we either have to say, collectively, that we don't want to
support ACPI on ARM64 except on systems that are fully SBSA compliant or
we have to find a way to make things work. I'm not sure we really want
the first option and the quirk is a good compromise to get us the second
option.

You seemed to be categorically rejecting this patch only because the
system wasn't fully SBSA compliant. Given that other, non-SBSA compliant
devices are currently supported, it certainly seemed like you were
singling out.

Anyway, like you said, it's ultimately up to Bjorn to take this or not,
so it's not productive to go back and forth on this between the two of
us.

Perhaps a more productive way to go forward would be to look at what you
had in mind in terms of a deprecation plan for the MCFG quirks. One idea
that came up as we were discussing this internally was to move the quirk
code into the DesignWare driver. That is, instead of having this code
live in the ACPI code and referencing the DesignWare code, it'd be the
DesignWare driver itself that would initialize PCI. This would have the
added benefit that MSIs could be used, since the DesignWare driver does
have the means of decoding which MSI occurred. The same code that is
used to do this when booting from DT could be reused when booting from
ACPI.

The benefits here would be that we'd move the code out of the quirks, so
we'd be effectively relying less on those quirks, which in turn would
help to deprecate them.

Now, I'm not exactly sure I understand your concerns regarding
maintainability of these quirks, so maybe that proposal isn't really
what you're looking for. Perhaps you have a better idea?
