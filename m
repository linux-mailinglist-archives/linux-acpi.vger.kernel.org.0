That's not ok.  Linux is a "general purpose" operating system and needs
to work well for all applications.  Doing application-specific-tuning
based on the specific hardware like this is a nightmare for users, and
will be for you as you will now have to support this specific model to
work correctly on all future kernel releases for the next 20+ years.
Are you willing to do that?

Then perhaps it isn't anything that they should try out :)

Shouldn't the kernel know how the application works (based on the
resources it asks for) and tune itself based on that automatically?

If not, how is a user supposed to know how to do this?

What is "1024" here?  Where is any of this documented?  And why these
specific sysfs files and not others?

If you have no such user today, nor a library, how do you know any of
this works well?  And again, how will you support this going forward?
Or is this specific api only going to be for one specific piece of
hardware and never any future ones?

So you haven't tested this on any real applications?  We need real users
before being able to add new apis.  Otherwise we can just remove the
apis :)

Kernel programming for a general purpose operating system is hard, but
it is possible :)

good luck!
