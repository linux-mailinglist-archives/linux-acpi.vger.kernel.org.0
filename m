IIUC, the Xen hypervisor:

  - Interprets /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/APIC (or gets this via
    something running on the Dom0 kernel) to find the physical base
    address and GSI base, e.g., from I/O APIC, I/O SAPIC.

  - Needs the GSI to locate the APIC and pin within the APIC.  The
    Dom0 kernel is the OSPM, so only it can evaluate the AML _PRT to
    learn the PCI device -> GSI mapping.

  - Has direct access to the APIC physical base address to program the
    Redirection Table.

The patch seems a little messy to me because the PCI core has to keep
track of the GSI even though it doesn't need it itself.  And the
current patch exposes it on all arches, even non-ACPI ones or when
ACPI is disabled (easily fixable).

We only call acpi_pci_irq_enable() in the pci_enable_device() path, so
we don't know the GSI unless a Dom0 driver has claimed the device and
called pci_enable_device() for it, which seems like it might not be
desirable.

I was hoping we could put it in /sys/firmware/acpi/interrupts, but
that looks like it's only for SCI statistics.  I guess we could moot a
new /sys/firmware/acpi/gsi/ directory, but then each file there would
have to identify a device, which might not be as convenient as the
/sys/devices/ directory that already exists.  I guess there may be
GSIs for things other than PCI devices; will you ever care about any
of those?
