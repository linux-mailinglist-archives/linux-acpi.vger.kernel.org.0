Ah, I was assuming this pcie-hisi-error.c driver was for the same
device claimed by pcie-hisi.c.

Error drivers like this will have some device-specific knowledge
(e.g., which registers to dump), but I guess they'll always be
used with the generic acpi/pci_root.c driver, right?

It looks like this driver has little or nothing to do with the PCI
core directly.  It does include drivers/pci/pci.h, but I'm not sure it
really needs it.

Maybe drivers/pci/controller/ is the best place for it, but I'm not
sure.  It's a little confusing because it's not really like the other
things there.

There are some vaguely similar things in drivers/acpi/apei/ and
drivers/acpi/nfit/.  And of course there are .acpi_match_table uses
all over the drivers/ tree.  Maybe we need a new subdirectory under
drivers/pci?  drivers/pci/controller/apei/?

Any thoughts, Rafael?
