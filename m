With regards to URs resulting in unwanted aborts or similar - this seems
to be a very common theme amongst ARM PCI controller drivers. For example
both ARM32 imx6 and ARM32 keystone have fault handlers to handle an abort
and fabricate a 0xffffffff read value.

The ARM32 rcar driver, whilst it doesn't appear to produce an abort, does
read the PCI_STATUS register after making a config read to determine if
any aborts have happened - in which case it reports
PCIBIOS_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND.

And as recently reported [1], the rockchip driver also appears to produce
aborts.

I suspect that this ARM64 controller driver won't be the last either. Thus
any solution here may form the basis of copy-cat solutions for subsequent
controllers.

From my understanding of the issues, the ARM64 serrors are imprecise and
as a result there isn't a sensible way of using them to determine that a
read is a UR. So where there are no other solutions to suppress the
generation of an abort by the controller, the only solutions that seem to
exist are 1) pre-scan the devices in firmware and only talk to those devices
in Linux - a safe option but limiting - perhaps with side effects for CRS
and 2) the approach rcar takes in using the PCI_STATUS register - though
you'd end up having to mask the serror (PSTATE.A) for a limited period of
time - a risky option (you'll miss real serrors) - but with no side effects.

(I don't know if option 2 is feasible in this case by the way).
