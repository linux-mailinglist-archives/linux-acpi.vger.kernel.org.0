Have you actually looked at this macro?  It is a wrapper around
ACPI_COMPANION().

So they may think that they don't use struct acpi_device pointers, but
in fact they do.

So there is a difference between "limiting to ACPICA" and "reducing".
It cannot be limited to ACPICA, because the code outside ACPICA needs
to evaluate ACPI objects sometimes and ACPI handles are needed for
that.

And this observation doesn't invalidate the point.

I see no particular reason to do that, though.

What specifically is a problem with passing struct acpi_device
pointers to the wrappers?  I don't see any TBH.

So one can use ACPI_COMPANION() just as well and it is slightly less overhe=
ad.

You don't really have to repeat the same argument  several times and I
know how ACPI_HANDLE() works.  Also I don't like some of the things
done by this patch.

Whoever uses ACPI_HANDLE(), they also use ACPI_COMPANION() which is
hidden in the former.

If they don't need to store either the acpi_handle or the struct
acpi_device pointer, there is no reason at all to use the former
instead of the latter.

If they get an acpi_handle from somewhere else than ACPI_HANDLE(),
then yes, they would need to get the ACPI devices from there (which is
possible still), but they may be better off by using the raw ACPICA
interface for events in that case.

Yes, that's the common case.

I thought you meant some code duplication related to passing struct
acpi_device pointers to the wrappers, but we agree that the wrappers
are generally useful.

Well, I know what's going on now.

You really want to add a context argument to
acpi_dev_install_notify_handler(), which is quite reasonable, but then
you don't have to change the first argument of it.

I'll send you my version of this patch later today and we'll see.
