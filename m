I've been working on this today. I've mostly been going through
the all the existing bugs about this, to make a list of DMI matches
for devices on which we should _not_ do e820 clipping to fix th
kernel being unable to assign BARs there.

I've found an interesting pattern there, all affected devices
are Lenovo devices with "IIL" in there device name, e.g. :
"IdeaPad 3 15IIL05". I've looked up all Lenovo devices which
have "IIL" as part of their DMI_PRODUCT_VERSION string here:
https://github.com/linuxhw/DMI/

And then looked them up at https://linux-hardware.org/ and checked
their dmesg to see if they have the e820 problem other ideapads
have. I've gone through approx. half the list now and all
except one model seem to have the e820 problem.

So it looks like we might be able to match all problem models
with a single DMI match.

So the problem seems to be limited to one specific device
series / range and this is making me have second thoughts
about doing a date based cut-off at all. Trying to switch
over any models which are new in 2023 is fine, the problem
with a DMI BIOS date approach though is that as soon as some
new management-engine CVE comes out we will also see BIOS
updates with a year of 2023 for many existing models, of
up to 3-4 years old at least; and chances are that some of
those older models getting BIOS updates will be bitten by
this change.

So as said I'm having second thoughts about the date based
approach. Bjorn, what do you think of just using DMI quirks
to disable e820 clipping on known problematic models and
otherwise keeping things as is ?

Note I'm also fine with going with the 2023 date based
approach, I'm just wondering if that will be a good idea
and not something which we might regret later.

Regards,

Hans


p.s.

I've seen your email about the Acer laptop; I'll take
a look at that coming Wednesday.
