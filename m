Hi Linus,

Please pull from the tag

 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm.git \
 pm-5.5-rc1

with top-most commit e350b60f4e0f089f585d738e27213c8133fe9093

 Merge branches 'pm-avs', 'pm-docs' and 'pm-tools'

on top of commit 05ff1ba412fd6bd48d56dd4c0baff626533728cc

 PM: QoS: Invalidate frequency QoS requests after removal

to receive power management updates for 5.5-rc1.

These include cpuidle changes to use nanoseconds (instead of
microseconds) as the unit of time and to simplify checks for
disabled idle states in the idle loop, some cpuidle fixes and
governor updates, assorted cpufreq updates (driver updates
mostly and a few core fixes and cleanups), devfreq updates
(dominated by the tegra30 driver changes), new CPU IDs for
the RAPL power capping driver, relatively minor updates of
the generic power domains (genpd) and operation performance
points (OPP) frameworks, and assorted fixes and cleanups.

There are also two maintainer information updates: Chanwoo Choi will
be maintaining the devfreq subsystem going forward and Todd Brandt is
going to maintain the pm-graph utility (created by him).

Specifics:

 - Use nanoseconds (instead of microseconds) as the unit of time in
   the cpuidle core and simplify checks for disabled idle states in
   the idle loop (Rafael Wysocki).

 - Fix and clean up the teo cpuidle governor (Rafael Wysocki).

 - Fix the cpuidle registration error code path (Zhenzhong Duan).

 - Avoid excessive vmexits in the ACPI cpuidle driver (Yin Fengwei).

 - Extend the idle injection infrastructure to be able to measure the
   requested duration in nanoseconds and to allow an exit latency
   limit for idle states to be specified (Daniel Lezcano).

 - Fix cpufreq driver registration and clarify a comment in the
   cpufreq core (Viresh Kumar).

 - Add NULL checks to the show() and store() methods of sysfs
   attributes exposed by cpufreq (Kai Shen).

 - Update cpufreq drivers:

   * Fix for a plain int as pointer warning from sparse in
     intel_pstate (Jamal Shareef).

   * Fix for a hardcoded number of CPUs and stack bloat in the
     powernv driver (John Hubbard).

   * Updates to the ti-cpufreq driver and DT files to support new
     platforms and migrate bindings from opp-v1 to opp-v2 (Adam Ford,
     H. Nikolaus Schaller).

   * Merging of the arm_big_little and vexpress-spc drivers and
     related cleanup (Sudeep Holla).

   * Fix for imx's default speed grade value (Anson Huang).

   * Minor cleanup of the s3c64xx driver (Nathan Chancellor).

   * CPU speed bin detection fix for sun50i (Ondrej Jirman).

 - Appoint Chanwoo Choi as the new devfreq maintainer.

 - Update the devfreq core:

   * Check NULL governor in available_governors_show sysfs to prevent
     showing wrong governor information and fix a race condition
     between devfreq_update_status() and trans_stat_show() (Leonard
     Crestez).

   * Add new 'interrupt-driven' flag for devfreq governors to allow
     interrupt-driven governors to prevent the devfreq core from
     polling devices for status (Dmitry Osipenko).

   * Improve an error message in devfreq_add_device() (Matthias
     Kaehlcke).

 - Update devfreq drivers:

   * tegra30 driver fixes and cleanups (Dmitry Osipenko).

   * Removal of unused property from dt-binding documentation for
     the exynos-bus driver (Kamil Konieczny).

   * exynos-ppmu cleanup and DT bindings update (Lukasz Luba, Marek
     Szyprowski).

 - Add new CPU IDs for CometLake Mobile and Desktop to the Intel RAPL
   power capping driver (Zhang Rui).

 - Allow device initialization in the generic power domains (genpd)
   framework to be more straightforward and clean it up (Ulf Hansson).

 - Add support for adjusting OPP voltages at run time to the OPP
   framework (Stephen Boyd).

 - Avoid freeing memory that has never been allocated in the
   hibernation core (Andy Whitcroft).

 - Clean up function headers in a header file and coding style in the
   wakeup IRQs handling code (Ulf Hansson, Xiaofei Tan).

 - Clean up the SmartReflex adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) driver for
   ARM (Ben Dooks, Geert Uytterhoeven).

 - Wrap power management documentation to fit in 80 columns (Bjorn
   Helgaas).

 - Add pm-graph utility entry to MAINTAINERS (Todd Brandt).

 - Update the cpupower utility:

   * Fix the handling of set and info subcommands (Abhishek Goel).

   * Fix build warnings (Nathan Chancellor).

   * Improve mperf_monitor handling (Janakarajan Natarajan).

There is a merge conflict of this with the PCI tree (specifically in the
PCI power management documentation) that has been addressed by the
appended patch from Stephen in linux-next.

Thanks!

  At the time of this writing there are two ways to define power management
  callbacks for a PCI device driver, the recommended one, based on using a
  dev_pm_ops structure described in Documentation/driver-api/pm/devices.rst, and
- the "legacy" one, in which the .suspend() and .resume() callbacks from struct
- pci_driver are used.  The legacy approach, however, doesn't allow
one to define
- runtime power management callbacks and is not really suitable for any new
- drivers.  Therefore it is not covered by this document (refer to the
source code
- to learn more about it).

  It is recommended that all PCI device drivers define a struct
