Sure, I started building the 6.13 kernel and will post more
information if I notice the issue on the 6.13 kernel.

Regarding the CommClk- (Common Clock Configuration) bit, it indicates
whether the common clock configuration is enabled or disabled. When it
is set to CommClk-, it means that the common clock configuration is
disabled.

LnkCtl: ASPM Disabled; RCB 64 bytes Disabled- CommClk-
        ExtSynch- ClockPM- AutWidDis- BWInt- AutBWInt-

For my device, I noticed that the common clock configuration is
disabled. Could this be causing the BAR reset issue?

How is the CommClk bit determined(to set or clear)? and is it okay to
enable this bit after booting the kernel?
