Perhaps useful to add a quote from the DOE ECN here.
This is in an implementation note on Page 6.

"The DOE Busy bit can be used to indicate that the DOE responder is
 temporarily unable to accept a data object. It is necessary for a
 DOE requester to ensure that individual data object transfers are
 completed, and that a request/response contract is completed, for
 example using a mutex mechanism to block other conflicting traffic
 for cases where such conflicts are possible."

Given you must not issue a second request to a given protocol until
the response is received (unless you issue an abort) you can't safely
do anything if we assume userspace might be using the DOE directly
other than by issuing an abort every time.

I had previously missed that a DOE busy clear can cause an interrupt
but that would only avoid us polling for busy (probably not worth
the handling code). It doesn't help us with this problem.
