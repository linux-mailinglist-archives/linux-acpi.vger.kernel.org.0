Well, that's how acpi_bus_trim() is supposed to work: Detach
everything under the target device (and including that device itself)
unconditionally.

I would prefer to rename acpi_bus_trim_one() to something closer
reflecting its purpose.

Sure, that will produce more readable patches.

The reason for using void * here is that this function is called
recursively via acpi_dev_for_each_child_reverse() which requires a
pointer as the second arg.

I guess I could define a wrapper around it for this, but that would be
more code without any functional difference.

Functional and enabled, but not present would go against the spec.  I
guess the kernel could protect itself against this, but then whatever
it chooses to do has not been defined anyway.

The spec doesn't actually say what the OSPM is supposed to do when it
sees that combination of bits.  I'm inclined to clarify it to say "if
bit [0] is cleared, bit [1] has no defined meaning and it should be
ignored by the OSPM".  To be consistent with this interpretation,
acpi_device_is_enabled() should return "(present and enabled) or
functional".

I'll change it along these lines.
