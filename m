This is what I was referring to when I mentioned bus topology related metad=
ata.

This is why those uses of ACPI_ID_LEN outside of struct acpi_device_id
may potentially be dangerous, given that _CIDs are apparently
effectively unbounded in size. But relying on this to justify the
"VM_GEN_COUNTER" CID is a bit of a stretch, IMO.
