I'm aware of the _REG(EC, 0) part, but I thought that it might be the
right thing to do.

First off, I'm a bit concerned about leaving the EC address space
handler attached to the root node after we have discovered the proper
EC object in the namespace, because that's inconsistent with the "no
ECDT" case.

It leaves a potential problem on the table too, because acpi_ec_add()
changes boot_ec->handle from ACPI_ROOT_OBJECT to ec->handle and if
ec_remove_handlers() is called for it after that, it will fail to
remove the handler, but it will clear the
EC_FLAGS_EC_HANDLER_INSTALLED flag (so the change above is actually
incorrect, because it should remove the handler before changing
boot_ec->handle).

But in order to move the EC address space handler under the EC object,
it needs to be uninstalled and for this purpose AML needs to be told
that it's not there, so evaluating _REG(EC, 0) seems reasonable to me
even though I agree that it is somewhat risky.

Second, the spec is kind of suggesting doing it (cf. the "These
operation regions may become inaccessible after OSPM runs
_REG(EmbeddedControl, 0)" comment in the _REG definition section).

Moreover, I don't quite like the ACPI_NO_INSTALL_SPACE_HANDLER flag,
because it causes the "handler installation" to actually do something
else.

Well, as stated above, I think it would be prudent to move the handler
under the EC object proper once it has been discovered.

Overall, I think that we'll need a new "no _REG" variant of
acpi_install_address_space_handler(), at least for backward
compatibility with other OSes using ACPICA, but I would call it
acpi_install_address_space_handler_no_reg() and do all of the flags
(or BOOL for that matter) passing internally in evxfregn.c.

Thanks!
