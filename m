IMO, this can be done in one patch, but this would probably go via
Rafael.

When ghes_init() is an initcall and you return -ENODEV for the
HEST_NOT_FOUND case, I don't think we log any message about that, do
we?  do_one_initcall() will capture and return the -ENODEV, but the
caller (do_initcall_level()) just ignores it.

I think it is not necessary to save information that will never be
used.  If you need it in the future, you can add it and the reason
will be obvious.
