How did you pick 2018?  Prior to this patch, we used E820 reservations
for all machines.  This patch would change that for 2019-2022
machines, so there's a risk of breaking some of them.

I'm hesitant about changing the behavior for machines already in the
field because if they were tested at all with Linux, it was without
this patch.  So I would lean toward preserving the current behavior
for BIOS year < 2023.

I think we should add_taint(TAINT_FIRMWARE_WORKAROUND) for both these
cases.

We probably should do it for *all* the parameters here, but that would
be a separate discussion.
