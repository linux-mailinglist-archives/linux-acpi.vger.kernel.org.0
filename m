I don't think this sentence makes sense, or at least it is not easy to
parse. It implies that it can "point to" other properties too - but
that's not the case. It is only valid to "point to" these suppliers.
I'd drop this entirely.

"it would be safe to assume" seems odd wording to me - I feel like the
default is stronger than "safe to assume". I'd just drop the "would be
safe to assume and replace with "is assumed".

Otherwise, I think this is a great description, describing the use case
well :)

Rob's bot rightfully complains here about invalid syntax. What you
actually want to enforce here is any number of device phandles, but
these phandles all contain only the label and no indices etc, right?

This clearly was never tested, Rob's bot warnings aside. You're missing
a ; at EOL here and with the other clock below.=20
