I think I might not be properly understanding your concern. There are two types
of errors in UAPI that represent 3 error conditions:

1. errno from the ioctl - parameter invalid kind of stuff, this would include using
   the vendor A UAPI on vendor B's device (assuming matching opcodes).
2. errno from the ioctl - transport error of some sort in the mailbox command -
   timeout on doorbell kind of thing.
3. cxl_send_command.retval - Device's error code.

Did that address your concern?

I respect your opinion, but my opinion is that driver writers absolutely cannot
rely on that. It would further the conversation a great deal to get concrete
examples of commands that couldn't be part of the core spec and had no effects.
I assume all vendors are going to avoid doing that, which is a real shame.

So far I haven't seen the consortium shoot something down from a vendor because
it is too vendor specific...
