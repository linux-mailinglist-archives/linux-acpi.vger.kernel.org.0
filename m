There are only two existing coresight devices with both AMBA and platform
drivers available i.e replicator and funnel. Such devices could use these
new helpers right from the beginning. As you mentioned earlier such changes
might be folded back into the patch adding the helpers.

But coresight devices such as catu, tpiu, tmc, stm and debug don't have
platform drivers to begin with. Hence the helpers could only be used in
their respective patches adding platform drivers.

> is cleaner and easier to review. And (2) & (3) could be in the same patch for each driver, but please add something in the description for (2).

Please find the updated commit message here, does this look okay ?

    coresight: replicator: Move ACPI support from AMBA driver to platform driver

    Add support for the dynamic replicator device in the platform driver, which
    can then be used on ACPI based platforms. This change would now allow
    runtime power management for replicator devices on ACPI based systems.

    The driver would try to enable the APB clock if available. Also, rename the
    code to reflect the fact that it now handles both static and dynamic
    replicators. But first this refactors replicator_probe() making sure it can
    be used both for platform and AMBA drivers, by moving the pm_runtime_put()
    to the callers.
