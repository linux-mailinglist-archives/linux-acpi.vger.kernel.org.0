Hello My Dear.

Please do not feel disturbed for contacting =C2=A0you in this regards, It
was based on the critical health condition I find mine self. =C2=A0My names
 are Mrs. Hannah Wilson David, a widow and I=E2=80=99m suffering from brain
tumor disease and this illness has gotten to a very bad stage, I
 married my husband for Ten years without any family members and no
child. =C2=A0My husband died after a brief illness that lasted for few
days.

Since the death of my husband, I decided not to remarry again, When my
late husband was alive he deposited the sum of =C2=A0($  11,450,000.00,
Nine Million Four Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars) with the Bank.
Presently this money is still in bank. And My  Doctor told me that I
don't have much time to live because my illness has gotten to a very
bad stage, Having known my condition I  decided to entrust over the
deposited fund under your custody to take care of the less-privileged
ones therein your country or position,
which i believe that you will utilize this money the way I am going to
instruct herein.

However all I need and required from you is your sincerity and ability
to carry out the transaction successfully and fulfill my final wish in
implementing the charitable project as it requires absolute trust and
devotion without any failure and I will be glad to see that the bank
finally release and transfer the fund into your bank account in your
country even before I die here in the hospital, because my present
health condition is very critical at the moment everything needs to be
process rapidly as soon as possible.

It will be my pleasure to compensate you as my Investment
Manager/Partner with 35 % percent of the total fund for your effort in
 handling the transaction, 5 % percent for any expenses or processing
charges fee that will involve during this process while 60% of the
fund will be Invested into the charity project there in your country
for the mutual benefit of the orphans and the less privileges ones.

Meanwhile I am waiting for your prompt respond, if only you are
interested for further details of the transaction and execution of
this  humanitarian project for the glory and honor of God the merciful
compassionate.

May bless you and your family.
Regards,
Mrs. Hannah Wilson David.
