What exactly are you suggesting here? That the contributor of this
patch joins the UEFI forum as an individual adopter in order to get
the ACPI spec updated before we can advance with this patch? Or that
he works with Microsoft to get them to refrain from violating it?

I don't think that is reasonable or realistic. The kernel is already
riddled with UEFI and ACPI quirks that are only there because some
teams at MS don't take the ACPI spec too literally (which is why they
have their own AML compiler, for one), and PC vendors only care about
the Windows sticker, so they don't care about the ACPI spec either.

So I don't think this is the right time to get pedantic about this.
Our ACPI subsystem already deals with CIDs that are longer than 8
characters (which are btw permitted by the ACPI spec for bus topology
related metadata), the only thing being changed here is the ability to
actually match against such identifiers.
