I'm not the expert on page allocation, but ...

I don't think GFP_ACCOUNT makes allocations fail.  It might make reclaim
happen from within that cgroup, and it might cause an OOM kill for
something in that cgroup.  But I don't think it makes a (low order)
allocation more likely to fail.

There's usually less memory avilable in DMA/DMA32 zones, but we have
so few allocations from those zones, I question the utility of focusing
testing on those allocations.

GFP_ATOMIC allows access to emergency pools, so I would say _less_ likely
to fail.  KSWAPD_RECLAIM has no effect on whether _this_ allocation
succeeds or fails; it kicks kswapd to do reclaim, rather than doing
reclaim directly.  DIRECT_RECLAIM definitely makes allocations more likely
to succeed.  GFP_FS allows (direct) reclaim to happen from filesystems.
GFP_IO allows IO to start (ie writeback can start) in order to clean
dirty memory.

Anyway, I hope somebody who knows the page allocator better than I do
can say smarter things than this.  Even better if they can put it into
Documentation/ somewhere ;-)

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/memory-allocation.html
exists but isn't quite enough to answer this question.
