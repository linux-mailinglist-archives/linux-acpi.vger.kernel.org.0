Exactly like I said: If you only allow one driver to use the _DSM to
request the Aux power from a given Root Port, it will have all of the
information and does not need to be notified about any changes.  Since
no one else is allowed to use this interface for that Root Port, no
one else will need a notifier either.  For this to work, you need some
mechanism allowing drivers to claim the interface so no one else can
use it (on a per Root Port basis) which is currently missing AFAICS.
I think that this is the option you want to pursue.

OTOH, if you want to allow multiple drivers to use this interface for
the same Root Port, you need to aggregate the requests (as required by
the spec IIUC) in the first place, or else the users can override each
other's request.  In that case you'll likely need a notification
mechanism of some sort to let the requesters know whether or not the
Aux power will be provided, but maybe that can be done through a
callback associated with a request.

The second option is genuinely more complicated because all of the
devices requesting the Aux power from the same Root Port cannot be
suspended independently in that case, so until there is a clear
real-world use case for it, my recommendation would be to go for the
first option.

But the first option means exclusive access and so no need for
notifiers and such.
