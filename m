Rather than quirking all these cases, which I get the feeling there
are many more than we've currently got in our quirk list, perhaps it'd
be simpler to default to the simple suspend. AFAIK, the simple suspend
works for all platforms, though it may not realize the best power savings
and/or exit latency.
