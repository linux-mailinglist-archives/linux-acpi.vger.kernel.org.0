Sure please do that. IMO, the driver is usually upstreamed first along with
the DT bindings(in ACPI case either the spec change or the std namespace node)
The actual addition of the device happens via DT. ACPI APMT needs creation
of device here but I prefer to see the driver first.

I read the APMT spec again and it has very little reference to coresight
though it is weirdly labelled as Coresight PMU for no sane reasons(Sorry I
know it's Arm to blame here and I bet something to do with marketing).

Anyways the APMT spec on its own covers all types of PMUs as I stated earlier.
So I prefer "arm-generic-pmu" or something better if you can come up with. I
am fine if you would like to retain arm-coresight-pmu when you post driver as
that's what the spec is labelled as.

Once you post the driver we can debate on that and come up with better name
with all the concerned parties involved.

Agreed, those are details we can discuss once you post with all the
maintainers involved.

Sure as I mentioned above that should be fine. I will then raise it with
the maintainers how we managed to labelled the spec to confuse it with other
components. I prefer whatever we add must be easy to identify and doesn't
conflict with existing PMUs(like ARM CPU PMUs, or the coresight ETM PMUs,
..etc)

In short, just post the driver the way you prefer and let us start the
discussion there.
