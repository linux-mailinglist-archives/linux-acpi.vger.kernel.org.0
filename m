Without a #define pr_fmt in the file there is no functional difference.

That is a non trivial question to answer, e.g. using devm_ functions
while the rest of the driver is not using them can be tricky and it
might be better to convert the whole driver over to devm_ use in one go.

All printk's in this file are prefixed with "PCI: " so converting to
pr_info() should probably involve adding this:

#define pr_fmt(fmt) "PCI: " fmt

So should I add that already while using pr_info() in this patch,
which would look weird / look like an unrelated change?

Or should I not add that and manually add the "PCI: " prefix,
requiring the pr_info to still be replaced in a subsequent patch
converting the rest over to pr_info() ?

IMHO it makes the most sense to keep printk here and then
replace the printk with a pr_info, dropping the "PCI: "
prefix in a subsequent patch converting all the printk-s.

That would also make the subsequent patch cleaner, because
replacing a pr_info with a pr_info in that patch would
look weird.

Regards,

Hans
