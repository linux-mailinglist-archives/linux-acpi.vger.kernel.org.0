Probably worth mentioning with the clairvoyance of the root cause of the 
issue that prompted this conversation I've now discovered another system 
with the exact same problem.  It's a different OEM, different generation 
of hardware and a different IBV that they use for their firmware.

I've also looked through the BIOS for a variety of reference designs and 
I don't see a _CRS entry in any of them.

I'm fairly certain we're just getting lucky in Linux on a lot of devices 
that the region is often overlapping with a region for EFI runtime services.

At least the OEMs that I talk to use FWTS.  FWTS catches this issue, but 
it's marked as LOW.  Everyone fixates on the HIGH or CRITICAL.

Given the severity of what I've seen it can do to a system I'm proposing 
FWTS to move it to HIGH:

Of course.  But it also means it's worth looking at the semantics of why 
Windows works.

I guess I'm naïve in that I don't know how exactly to check what Windows
*really* does (gets lucky from top down or actually reserves from MCFG).

But I do feel the OS doing it from top down vs bottom up is tangential 
to the decision of whether or not make a reservation in Linux for 
something you know about without a _CRS entry.

I can push AMD's reference designs to improve, I can push OEMs I talk to 
improve and I can try to influence FWTS but I have to ask:

What is the actual *harm* in just using this MCFG table to make a 
reservation when there isn't a PNP0C02 _CRS region declared?

At worst (a buggy BIOS) you would end up with hole in the memory map 
that isn't usable for devices.  At best you end up with more working 
devices without changing the firmware.
