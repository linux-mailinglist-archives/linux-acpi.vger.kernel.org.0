Yes, that's what I want from the generic fwnode APIs.
(Keyword: generic)

As you stated, the problem is in the typec_switch_match(). So, it's not related
to the fwnode, but how you are using it.

fwnode (as being an abstraction on top of the others) has no knowledge
about this. And more important should not know that.

The caller (if it wants to!) may create different callbacks for count and real
matching, no?
