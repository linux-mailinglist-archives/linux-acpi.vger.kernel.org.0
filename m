Subject: [PATCH v2 3/3] PCI / ACPI: Add _PR0 dependent devices

If otherwise unrelated PCI devices share ACPI power resources turning
them on causes the devices to enter D0uninitialized power state which may
cause problems.

For example in Intel Ice Lake two root ports (RP0 and RP1), Thunderbolt
controller (NHI) and xHCI controller all share power resources as can be
ween in the topology below where power resources are marked with []:

  Host bridge
    |
    +- RP0 ---\
    +- RP1 ---|--+--> [TBT]
    +- NHI --/   |
    |            |
    |            v
    +- xHCI --> [D3C]

In a situation where all devices sharing the power resources are in
D3cold (the power resources are turned off) and for example the
Thunderbolt controller is runtime resumed resulting that the power
resources are turned on. This means that the other devices sharing them
(RP0, RP1 and xHCI) are transitioned into D0uninitialized state. If they
were configured to trigger wake (PME) on a certain event that
configuration gets lost after reset so we would need to re-initialize
them to get the wakeup working as expected again. To do so we would need
to runtime resume all of them to make sure their registers get restored
properly before we can runtime suspend them again.

Since we just added concept of "_PR0 dependent device" we can solve this
by calling the relevant add/remove functions when the PCI device is bind
to its ACPI representation. If it has power resources the PCI device
will be added as dependent device to them and runtime resumed whenever
they are physically turned on. This should make sure PCI core can
reconfigure wakes after the device is transitioned into D0uninitialized.
