Dear Beloved.
I am General.Flora from the USA working in the US Army but presently
in Yemen, for a peacekeeping mission, I have something very important
to discuss with you. Some money in various currencies where discovered
in barrels at a farm house in the middle East during a rescue
operation in Iraq  War and it was agreed by Sergeant Kenneth Buff and
myself that some part of these money be shared between us, I was given
a total of ($13.5 Million US Dollars) as my own share , I kept this
money in a security company for a long while now which i declared and
deposit as my personal and family  treasure and it has been secured
and protected for years now with the security company.

Now, the WAR in Iraq is over, and all possible problems that could
have emanated from the shared money has been totally cleaned up and
all files closed, all what was discovered in the Middle East is no
more discussed, i am ready to retire from active services by the end
of next month, but, i need a trustworthy person that can help me take
possession of this funds and keep it safe while i work on my
retirement letter to join you so that we could discuss possible
business partnership together with the money. You can confirm the
genuineness of the findings by clicking on this website.

I=E2=80=99m seeking your kind assistance to move the sum of($13.5 Million U=
S
Dollars) to you as long as you will assure me that the money will be
safe in your care until I complete my service here in (Yemen) before
the end of next month. The most important thing is; =E2=80=9CCan I Trust
you=E2=80=9D?As an officer on  ACTIVE DUTY I am not allowed to have access =
to
money, therefore, I have declared the content of the consignment as
personal and my treasure. I would like to deliver to you. You will be
rewarded with 30% of this funds for your assistance, all that I
require is your mutual trust between us. Don=E2=80=99t betray me when you
receive the consignment.

Sincerely,
General.Flora.
