IMHO, both enforce HMAT/CDAT/etc is correct and enforce drivers to use
general interface we provided.  Anyway, we should try to make HMAT/CDAT
works well, so drivers want to use them :-)

Only if different algorithms follow the same basic principle.  For
example, the abstract distance of default DRAM nodes are fixed
(MEMTIER_ADISTANCE_DRAM).  The abstract distance of the memory device is
in linear direct proportion to the memory latency and inversely
proportional to the memory bandwidth.  Use the memory latency and
bandwidth of default DRAM nodes as base.

HMAT and CDAT report the raw memory latency and bandwidth.  If there are
some other methods to report the raw memory latency and bandwidth, we
can use them too.
