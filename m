IMHO I'm actually trying to precisely do what I think was the
conclusion of our discussion, and then some changes because of the
further feedback I received on those patches. Let's take a step back
and please allow me to explain how I got here (my apologies but this
spans a couple of threads, and I"m trying to tie them all together
here):

GOAL: To allow user space to control what (PCI) drivers he wants to
allow on external (thunderbolt) ports. There was a lot of debate about
the need for such a policy at
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/CACK8Z6GR7-wseug=TtVyRarVZX_ao2geoLDNBwjtB+5Y7VWNEQ@mail.gmail.com/
with the final conclusion that it should be OK to implement such a
policy in userspace, as long as the policy is not implemented in the
kernel. The kernel only needs to expose bits & info that is needed by
the userspace to implement such a policy, and it can be used in
conjunction with "drivers_autoprobe" to implement this policy:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
....
That's an odd thing, but sure, if you want to write up such a policy for
your systems, great.  But that policy does not belong in the kernel, it
belongs in userspace.
....
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1) The post https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20200609210400.GA1461839@bjorn-Precision-5520/
lists out the approach that was agreed on. Replicating it here:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Expose the PCI pdev->untrusted bit in sysfs.  We don't expose this
    today, but doing so would be trivial.  I think I would prefer a
    sysfs name like "external" so it's more descriptive and less of a
    judgment.

    This comes from either the DT "external-facing" property or the
    ACPI "ExternalFacingPort" property.

  - All devices present at boot are enumerated.  Any statically built
    drivers will bind to them before any userspace code runs.

    If you want to keep statically built drivers from binding, you'd
    need to invent some mechanism so pci_driver_init() could clear
    drivers_autoprobe after registering pci_bus_type.

  - Early userspace code prevents modular drivers from automatically
    binding to PCI devices:

      echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers_autoprobe

    This prevents modular drivers from binding to all devices, whether
    present at boot or hot-added.

  - Userspace code uses the sysfs "bind" file to control which drivers
    are loaded and can bind to each device, e.g.,

      echo 0000:02:00.0 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/nvme/bind
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

2) As part of implementing the above agreed approach, when I exposed
PCI "untrusted" attribute to userspace, it ran into discussion that
concluded that instead of this, the device core should be enhanced
with a location attribute.
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20200618184621.GA446639@kroah.com/
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
...
The attribute should be called something like "location" or something
like that (naming is hard), as you don't always know if something is
external or not (it could be internal, it could be unknown, it could be
internal to an external device that you trust (think PCI drawers for
"super" computers that are hot pluggable but yet really part of the
internal bus).
....
"trust" has no direct relation to the location, except in a policy of
what you wish to do with that device, so as long as you keep them
separate that way, I am fine with it.
...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

And hence this patch. I don't see an attribute in USB comparable to
this new attribute, except for the boolean "removable" may be. Are you
suggesting to pull that into the device core instead of adding this
"physical_location" attribute?

3) The one deviation from the agreed approach in (1) is
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11633095/ . The reason is I
realized that contrary to what I earlier believed, we might not be
able to disable the PCI link to all external PCI devices at boot. So
external PCI devices may actually bind to drivers before userspace
comes up and does "echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers_autoprobe").

I'm really happy to do what you think is the right way as long as it
helps achieve my goal above. Really looking for clear directions here.

Thanks & Best Regards,

Rajat
