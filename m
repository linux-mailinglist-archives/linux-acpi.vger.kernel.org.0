Unfortunately our silicon does not have either Vendor-Specific Capability or
Vendor-Specific Extended Capability.

Studied commit 8531e283bee66050734fb0e89d53e85fd5ce24a4
Looks this method requires adding member (like can_stall) to struct 
pci_dev, looks difficult.

DSM method seems requires vendor specific guid, and code would be vendor 
specific.
Except adding uuid to some spec like pci_acpi_dsm_guid.
obj = acpi_evaluate_dsm(ACPI_HANDLE(bus->bridge), &pci_acpi_dsm_guid, 1,
IGNORE_PCI_BOOT_CONFIG_DSM, NULL);

Adding vendor-specific code to common files looks a bit ugly.
