Add helper functions __fw_devlink_link_to_consumers() and
__fw_devlink_link_to_suppliers() that convert fwnode links to device
links.

__fw_devlink_link_to_consumers() is for creating:
- Device links between a newly added device and all its consumer devices
  that have been added to driver core.
- Proxy SYNC_STATE_ONLY device links between the newly added device and
  the parent devices of all its consumers that have not been added to
  driver core yet.

__fw_devlink_link_to_suppliers() is for creating:
- Device links between a newly added device and all its supplier devices
- Proxy SYNC_STATE_ONLY device links between the newly added device and
  all the supplier devices of its child device nodes.
