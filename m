I see.  We seem to be getting to the bottom of the problem.

Well, this looks like a spec interpretation difference.

We thought that _SxD/_SxW would only be relevant for devices with ACPI
PM support, but the firmware people seem to think that those objects
are also relevant for PCI devices that don't have ACPI PM support
(because those devices are still power-manageable via PMCSR).  If
Windows agrees with that viewpoint, we'll need to adjust, but not
through adding _SxW checks in random places.
