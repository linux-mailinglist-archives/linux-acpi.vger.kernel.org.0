OK. It was the cc to linux-acpi@ and the authors of the
ACPI/SMBIOS-without-UEFI patches that threw me off here.

If we are talking about an internal interface for firmware components,
I'd be inclined to treat this as an implementation detail, as long as
the OS is not expected to consume these DT nodes.

However, I struggle to see the point of framing this information as a
'UEFI memory map'. Neither EDK2 nor u-boot consume this information
natively, and there is already prior art in both projects to consume
nodes following the existing bindings for device_type=memory and the
/reserved-memory node. UEFI runtime memory is generally useless
without UEFI runtime services, and UEFI boot services memory is just
free memory.

There is also an overlap with the handover between secure and
non-secure firmware on arm64, which is also DT based, and communicates
available memory as well as RAM regions that are reserved for firmware
use.

In summary, I don't see why a non-UEFI payload would care about UEFI
semantics for pre-existing memory reservations, or vice versa. Note
that EDK2 will manage its own memory map, and expose it via UEFI boot
services and not via DT.

OK, so device tree makes sense for this. This is how I implemented the
EDK2 port that targets QEMU/mach-virt - it consumes the DT to discover
the UART, RTC,, memory, PCI host bridge, etc.

But I don't see a use case for a UEFI memory map here.

Indeed. As long as this binding is never consumed by the OS, I don't
have any objections to it - I just fail to see the point.
