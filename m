Yeah. So the idea is you either are in a transient phase of the command and some
future kernel will have real support for fred - or a vendor is being short
sighted and not adding support for fred.

The short answer is, in an ideal world you are correct. See nvdimm as an example
of the real world.

The longer answer. Unless we want to wait until we have all the hardware we're
ever going to see, it's impossible to have a fully baked, and validated
interface. The RAW interface is my admission that I make no guarantees about
being able to provide the perfect interface and giving the power back to the
hardware vendors and their driver writers.

As an example, suppose a vendor shipped a device with their special vendor
opcode. They can enable their customers to use that opcode on any driver
version. That seems pretty powerful and worthwhile to me.

Or a more realistic example, we ship a driver that adds a command which is
totally broken. Customers can utilize the RAW interface until it gets fixed in a
subsequent release which might be quite a ways out.

I'll say the RAW interface isn't an encouraged usage, but it's one that I expect
to be needed, and if it's not we can always try to kill it later. If nobody is
actually using it, nobody will complain, right :D
