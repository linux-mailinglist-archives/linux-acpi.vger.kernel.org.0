It's more that the DT spec defines what is not used with UEFI. If UEFI
covers more than the DT Spec defined, then we should look at that.

I would look some into (IBM) PowerPC for any prior art in this area.
Unfortunately, not publicly documented other than any users.

I don't have much interest in picking this up unless there's some
wider agreement. From the previously referenced discussion[1], it
didn't seem like there was. But none of those folk are Cc'ed here.

This goes in the root node?

Can't these be covered by reserved-memory? The client is free to
reclaim any regions if it knows what they are.

Isn't this pretty much a property of a memory region as a whole. IOW,
couldn't it just go into /memory node(s)?
