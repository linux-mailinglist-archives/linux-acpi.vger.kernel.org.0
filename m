So this is the kind of thing that I would *not* want to get eartly.

I really would want to get just the infrastructure in to let people
start doing conversions.

And then the "mindlessly obvious patches that are done by scripting
and can not possibly matter".

The kinds that do not *need* review, because they are mechanical, and
that just cause pointless noise for the rest of the patches that *do*
want review.

Not this kind of thing that is so subtle that you have to explain it.
That's not a "scripted patch for no semantic change".

So leave the del_singleshot_timer_sync() cases alone, they are
irrelevant for the new infrastructure and for the "mindless scripted
conversion" patches.

Ok, these are relevant.

This is obviously what I'd want early so that people can start doign
this in their trees.

So honestly, I was literally hoping for a "this is the coccinelle
script" kind of patch.

Now there seems to be a number of patches here that are actualyl
really hard to see that they are "obviously correct" and I can't tell
if they are actually scripted or not.

They don't *look* scripted, but I can't really tell.  I looked at the
patches with ten lines of context, and I didn't see the immediately
following kfree() even in that expanded patch context, so it's fairly
far away.

Others in the series were *definitely* not scripted, doing clearly
manual cleanups:

-    if (dch->timer.function) {
-        del_timer(&dch->timer);
-        dch->timer.function = NULL;
-    }
+    timer_shutdown(&dch->timer);

so no, this does *not* make me feel "ok, this is all trivial".

IOW, I'd really want *just* the infrastructure and *just* the provably
trivial stuff. If it wasn't some scripted really obvious thing that
cannot possibly change anything and that wasn't then edited manually
for some reason, I really don't want it early.

IOW, any early conversions I'd take are literally about removing pure
mindless noise. Not about doing conversions.

And I wouldn't mind it as a single conversion patch that has the
coccinelle script as the explanation.

Really just THAT kind of "100% mindless conversion".
