I'm hesitant to touch those, mostly as you said because they're
subjective (and I don't really see any big issues with them). Seems to
be the prevalent style in the drivers/acpi, although there are other
block-like separator comments at least in drivers/acpi/dock.c.

Yeah, any changes to drivers/acpi/acpica would have to go through their
repo.

I'll go over the checkpatch output later and prepare a v2 that doesn't
touch the comments, unless anyone has any issues with that.
