Hi Rafael,

Thank you for the feedback. If we add a generic location to type c
connector, would you suggest we do something similar to other devices
that would use PLD information? (like USB devices, HDMI ports, and so
on) Also, I am curious what you think about how to add generic
locations for Type A ports which I believe do not have connectors like
Type C. I would appreciate it if anyone can share any ideas. Thank you
very much!
