For QTG purposes, are we also supposed to take into account HB to
system interconnect type latency (or maybe nearest CPU?).
That is likely to be non trivial.

Stray sign off.

I'd like to see that gap closed asap. I think it is fairly obvious how to do
it, so shouldn't be too hard, just needs a dance to get the DOE for a switch
port using Lukas' updated handling of DOE mailboxes.

Similar to before, not good for readability to hide asignments in a list all on one line.
