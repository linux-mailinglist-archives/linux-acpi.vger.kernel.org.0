I don't pay attention to SBSA because I don't work in that space.
But AFAICT Tegra194 and most or all of the other arm64 PCIe host
controllers are not compliant with even PCIe with respect to ECAM.
They all seem to handle config space differently for the root port
than for downstream devices, and I don't think the spec allows that.

I'm not talking about new hardware that requires new drivers.  I'm
talking about *booting* and being usable.

It's clearly possible to boot old CDs on new x86 hardware.  Obviously
it won't have support for new endpoints, and it won't have support for
the latest DPC/EDR functionality, but it will at least boot and all
the basic functionality that *was* supported on old hardware will
still work.  In particular, it will enumerate all PCI devices and if
you plug in an old NIC, USB, SATA, etc device, it will work, so you
can bootstrap your way to install new drivers and new kernels.

This conversation is happening because PCI host bridges have a
standard driver ACPI, but Tegra194 *doesn't* work with it, so even if
you plug in an old e100 NIC, it's not going to work because the old
kernel can't enumerate any PCI devices.

Of course.  But we are talking specifically about a PCI host bridge,
which *does* have a standard ACPI driver.  It should work without
upstreaming any new code.
