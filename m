I'm glad you did this fix, and thanks for acknowledging Dan, but I
don't think it's necessary to mention it in the commit log here
because it won't really be useful in the future.  It's only relevant
when comparing the unmerged versions of this series, e.g., v4 compared
to v3.

If we were fixing something that's already been merged upstream, we
should absolutely include this, but since this hasn't been merged yet
Dan's report is basically the same as other review comments, which we
normally just address and mention in the change history in the [0/n]
cover letter (as you're already doing, thanks for that!).

Also, I think it's nice to CC: anybody who has commented on previous
versions of the patch series, so I added Dan to the CC: list here.
That way he can chime in if we're not addressing his report correctly.

As I mentioned in the other message, I think this file should be
drivers/pci/controller/dwc/pcie-hisi-error.c so it's right next to
pcie-hisi.c.  If there's some reason it needs to be here instead,
please mention that in the commit log.

Either align all the struct members or none of them.  Currently
hisi_pcie_err_data is aligned but hisi_pcie_err_info and
hisi_pcie_err_private are not.

Superfluous comment.

Align "struct platform_device ..." under "const struct
hisi_pcie_err_data ...".
