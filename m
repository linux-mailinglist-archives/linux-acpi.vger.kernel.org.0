You are saying the same thing but in a different way. A UEFI OS must
only rely on GetMemoryMap(), and not on the /reserved-memory node to
obtain this information. But this requirement needs to be stated
somewhere: the UEFI spec does not reason about other sources of EFI
memory information at all, and this DT schema does not mention any of
this either.

Funny, that is what I have been trying to get from you :-)

The problem I am anticipating here is that the information in
/reserved-memory may be out of sync with the EFI memory map. It needs
to be made clear that the EFI memory map is the only source of truth
when the OS is involved, and this /reserved-memory mechanism should
only be used by other firmware stages. But the schema does not mention
this at all. The schema also does not mention that the information in
/reserved-memory is not actually sufficient to reconstruct the EFI
memory map that the firmware payload expects (which is why the
upl-custom-node exists too)
