I believe another expected use of the cache ID exposed in sysfs is to 
program steering tags for cache stashing (typically in VFIO-based 
userspace drivers like DPDK so we can't realistically mediate it any 
other way). There were plans afoot last year to ensure that ACPI PPTT 
could provide the necessary ID values for arm64 systems which will 
typically be fairly arbitrary (but unique) due to reflecting underlying 
interconnect routing IDs. Assuming that there will eventually be some 
interest in cache stashing on DT-based systems too, we probably want to 
allow for an explicit ID property on DT cache nodes in a similar manner.

That said, I think it does make sense to have some kind of 
auto-generated fallback scheme *as well*, since I'm sure there will be 
plenty systems which care about MPAM but don't support stashing, and 
therefore wouldn't have a meaningful set of IDs to populate their DT 
with. Conversely I think that might also matter for ACPI too - one point 
I remember from previous discussions is that PPTT may use a compact 
representation where a single entry represents all equivalent caches at 
that level, so I'm not sure we can necessarily rely on IDs out of that 
path being unique either.

Robin.
