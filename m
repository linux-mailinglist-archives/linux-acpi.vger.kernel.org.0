I really would like to provide you more information about such
workaround but I'm not aware of any ;-) I have not seen any issues like
this when D3cold is properly implemented in the platform.  That's why
I'm bit skeptical that this has anything to do with specific Intel PCIe
ports. More likely it is some power sequence in the _ON/_OFF() methods
that is run differently on Windows.
