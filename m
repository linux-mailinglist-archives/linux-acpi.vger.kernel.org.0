Node names reflect the 'class', but not what's specifically in the
node. So really, all reserved-memory nodes should have the same name,
but that ship already sailed for existing users. 'compatible' is the
right thing here. As to what the node name should be, well, we haven't
defined that. I think we just used 'memory' on some platforms.

I agree. I think compatible is the better approach. Some property like
'discard' may not be sufficient information if the OS needs to consume
the region first and then discard it. Better to state exactly what's
there and then the OS can imply the rest.
