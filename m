I don't fully agree with the wording here, but apparently there is
some awareness here of the concerns I raised.

Interestingly, 'when booting via UEFI' becomes a bit ambiguous now,
given that DT is passed from stage to stage, and not every handover is
booting via UEFI. In general, I think the introduction of bindings
that cover areas other than the handover from the final boot loader to
the OS may create some more confusion later on, but I'll leave it up
to the DT bindings maintainer to reason about that.

If you are dead set on introducing these items (and I note that you
still have not provided an actual example of how a PI -> payload
handover would make use of runtime-code or boot-code reservations), I
won't keep standing in your way.

Thanks for the discussion, and apologies for dragging this out.
