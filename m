Well, the mailbox nature of PCC pretty much assures its "slow", relative 
the alternative of providing an actual register.  If a platform provides 
direct access to say MHU registers, then of course they won't actually 
be in a PCC region and the FIE will remain on.

The problem here is that these ACPI kernels are being shipped as single 
images in distro's which expect them to run on a wide range of platforms 
(including x86/amd in this case), and preform optimally on all of them.

So the 'n' option basically is saying that the latest FIE code doesn't 
provide a befit anywhere?
