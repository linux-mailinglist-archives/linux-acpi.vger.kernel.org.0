Thank you!

However, after giving some more consideration to this, I've realized
that it may still not be the cleanest way to address the issue at
hand.

Namely, there are two things we want to happen: (1) pci_target_state()
should return the original candidate target state if 'wakeup' is true,
but the device cannot signal PME from any states shallower than the
original one (including D0) and (2) __pci_enable_wake() should call
pci_pme_active() for devices that support signaling PME from D3cold
regardless of whether or not they support signaling PME from the power
state passed to it (because a device may end up in D3cold as a result
of a transition of the hierarchy above it and PME should be signaled
then).  They are only related to each other because the PME signaling
capability is taken into account in both places, but in fact (1) has
nothing to do with D3cold (and making it effectively depend on whether
or not the device can signal PME from D3cold is somewhat artificial)
and (2) has nothing to do with what the target power state of the
device is.  And so each of these two things should be covered by a
separate patch.

Let me post an alternative patch series in accordance with the above.
