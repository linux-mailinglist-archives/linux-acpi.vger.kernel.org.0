The problem is specific to the root port in D3hot over s2idle after the 
hardware has entered the deepest state.

It's fine any other time.

This particular root port only connects to the XHCI controllers and USB4 
controllers, so I can't confirm whether anything else is affected.

Yes; the AMD PMC driver does a notification to the platform that the OS 
is ready for it to go into a hardware sleep state [1].

If the AMD PMC driver isn't used, the platform is not notified that the 
OS is ready for it to go into hardware sleep state, and this issue will 
not occur.

So the PCI root port being in D3 while the hardware is in a sleep state 
is very accurate.

This function is only called during suspend, so it should cover hot 
added / hot removed devices.

If this ends up staying for v17 as is I'll add more verbose comments.

I did quirks in an earlier version of this series, but you had feedback 
that the solution isn't scalable.  That's why it's morphed into this 
approach, which I'd like to think is more scalable as it looks at the 
constraints advertised by the platform in an AMD specific driver.

Hans left feedback in v15 that if the device was already in D3 at the 
time of this function it wouldn't work properly.  So I excluded those 
devices.

It's was because pci_bridge_d3_update() can be called and change it 
again in other places.

I think if we want to optimize it to only run a single time we need a 
new variable or bit in the pci_dev structure that can be used to mark 
such an exclusion which pci_bridge_d3_update() could take into account.

This could fit in well with Hans' idea of drivers could register a 
callback to "veto" D3 support.  It could be something like 
pci_bridge_d3_update() is called whenever a new driver 
registers/unregisters the callback.  It might also fit in well with your 
previous comments about how you want to separate "spec compliant" things 
and "quirk" things in pci_bridge_d3_possible().

Could you comment on that?  He suggested it in the cover letter responses.

It's disabling both, which is why I left it as D3 to cover both.  The 
lack of constraint can't be explained in a single line message.  If this 
is too noisy for a user and you think would cause more questions than 
help I'm fine to downgrade it to debug.
