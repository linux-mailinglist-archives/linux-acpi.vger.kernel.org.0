I'm not sure what that would look like, I will have to mess with it a 
bit more, but as you can see its really just the two init entry points 
(one for the module, and one for the registered cpufreq), and their 
associated exit's which I'm not sure I see a way to simplify that short 
of maybe creating a second cpufreq_driver table, which replaces the 
.init calls with ones which include cppc_cpufreq_cpu_fie_init. The 
alternative is runtime setting the .init to switch between an init with 
FIE and one without. I'm not sure that clarifies what is happening in 
the code, and I thought in general dynamic runtime dispatch was to be 
avoided in the ACPI code when possible. Neither choice of course affects 
actual runtime because they are both firing during module load/unload.

Tristating the module parameter with default=detect, ON, OFF is a 
reasonable idea, and one I considered, but ignored because in the hisi 
quirk case even with ON it will have to be OFF, so it really ends up 
with 4 states default=detect, request ON, ON, OFF.

I'm good with any of this if people feel strongly about it.

Thanks for looking at this!
