Yes, I will update.

Yes, I will reword.

That's my bet too.

Thanks for your opinion on this!  Let's try to pursue the second then.

Lorenzo,

I have zero experience on any of those early arm64 platforms.  I would
appreciate it if you can give some direction on how to identify them.

Looking at your comment below, I'm wondering if it's true that the
firmware on those early arm64 platforms has no MCFG table but provide
root->mcfg_addr via _CBA method?

"I believe it is because there were arm64 platforms (early) that added a
consumer descriptor in the host bridge CRS with MMIO registers space in
it (I am not sure I can find the bug report - it has been a while,
remember the issue with non-ECAM config space and where to add the MMIO
resource required to "extend" MCFG config space ? I will never forget
that :))."

It would be very helpful if we can find someone running any of those
early platforms, so that we can ask favor to dump ACPI tables and test
things out.

Shawn
