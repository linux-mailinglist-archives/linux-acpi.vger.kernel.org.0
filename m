 During system-wide resume from a sleep state it's easiest to put devices into

+system transitions to the working state, especially if those devices had been in
 runtime suspend before the preceding system-wide suspend (or analogous)
-transition.  Device drivers can use the ``DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME`` flag to
-indicate to the PM core (and middle-layer code) that they prefer the specific
-devices handled by them to be left suspended and they have no problems with
-skipping their system-wide resume callbacks for this reason.  Whether or not the
-devices will actually be left in suspend may depend on their state before the
-given system suspend-resume cycle and on the type of the system transition under
-way.  In particular, devices are not left suspended if that transition is a
-restore from hibernation, as device states are not guaranteed to be reflected
-by the information stored in the hibernation image in that case.
-
-The middle-layer code involved in the handling of the device is expected to

-:c:member:`power.may_skip_resume` status bit which is checked by the PM core
-during the "noirq" phase of the preceding system-wide suspend (or analogous)

-appropriate in its "noirq" resume callback, which is executed regardless of
-whether or not the device is left suspended, but the other resume callbacks
-(except for ``->complete``) will be skipped automatically by the PM core if the
-device really can be left in suspend.

+transition.
+
+To that end, device drivers can use the ``DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME`` flag to
+indicate to the PM core and middle-layer code that they allow their "noirq" and
+"early" resume callbacks to be skipped if the device can be left in suspend
+after system-wide PM transitions to the working state.  Whether or not that is
+the case generally depend on the state of the device before the given system
+suspend-resume cycle and on the type of the system transition under way.
+In particular, driver callbacks are never skipped during the "restore"
+transition related to hibernation (because the actual states of devices at that
+time are not known in general, all of them are put into the full-power state
+then and configured to reflect their "active" working-state settings).
+
+The middle-layer code is expected to indicate to the PM core whether or not
+skipping the driver's "noirq" and "early" resume callbacks for a given device
+makes sense from its perspective by either setting or clearing the device's
+:c:member:`power.may_skip_resume` status bit (checked by the PM core during the
+"noirq" phase of the suspend, or analogous, transition).  Setting that status
+bit along with the ``DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME`` flag is necessary, but
+generally not sufficient, for the driver's "noirq" and "early" callbacks to be
+skipped.  Whether or not they should be skipped can be determined by evaluating
+the :c:func:`dev_pm_skip_resume` helper function.
+
+If that function returns ``true``, the driver's "noirq" and "early" resume
+callbacks should be skipped.  Otherwise, if the device was runtime-suspended
+during the preceding system-wide suspend transition, its runtime PM status needs
+to be set to "active" which is taken care of by the PM core.
+
+If the ``DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME`` flag is not set for a device, but
+``DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND`` is set and the driver's "late" and "noirq" suspend
+callbacks are skipped, its system-wide "noirq" and "early" resume callbacks, if
+present, are invoked as usual and the device's runtime PM status is set to
+"active" by the PM core before enabling runtime PM for it, so the driver must be
+prepared to cope with the invocation of its system-wide resume callbacks
+back-to-back with its ``->runtime_suspend`` one (without the intervening
+``->runtime_resume`` and system-wide suspend callbacks) and the final state of
+the device must reflect the "active" runtime PM status in that case.  [Note that
+this is not a problem at all if the driver's ``->suspend_late`` callback pointer
+points to the same function as its ``->runtime_suspend`` one and its
+``->resume_early`` callback pointer points to the same function as the
+``->runtime_resume`` one, while none of the other system-wide suspend-resume
+callbacks of the driver are present, for example.]
+
+Likewise, if ``DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME`` is set for a device, its driver's
+system-wide "noirq" and "early" resume callbacks may be skipped while its "late"
+and "noirq" suspend callbacks may have been executed (in principle, regardless
+of whether or not ``DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND`` is set).  In that case, the driver
+needs to be able to cope with the invocation of its ``->runtime_resume``
+callback back-to-back with its "late" and "noirq" suspend ones.  [Again, that
+is not a concern if the driver sets both ``DPM_FLAG_SMART_SUSPEND`` and
+``DPM_FLAG_MAY_SKIP_RESUME`` and uses the same pair of suspend/resume callback
+functions for runtime PM and system-wide suspend/resume.]
