Ideally enforced, if not at-least considered by the clients using this
PCC channel. I do agree it results in duplication and at the discretion
of the clients. I am thinking if we can provide some kind of helpers/
accessors to achieve that. Very rough idea still as mentioned in the
cover letter, not looked at all users in details. Some drivers map the
shared memory as normal/cached while majority expects it to be device/IO.
That is one difference to consider while we try to consolidate shmem
accesses. Happy to hear opinions here ðŸ˜„.
