I posted that other email before being awake and conflated MHU with AMU 
(which could potentially expose the values directly). But the CPPC code 
isn't aware of whether a MHU or some other mailbox is in use. Either 
way, its hard to imagine a general mailbox with a doorbell/wait for 
completion handshake will ever be fast enough to consider running at the 
granularity this code is running at. If there were a case like that, the 
kernel would have to benchmark it at runtime to differentiate it from 
something that is talking over a slow link to a slowly responding mgmt 
processor.
