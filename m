I am trying to follow the code. IIUC, the level one(I$ and D$) are skipped
in this logic and the private unified cache if any will get the cpu hwid as
the cache id which is all fine. But what happens if there are 2 levels of
unified private cache ? I am assuming we only care about shared caches for
MPAM and ignore private caches which sounds OK but I just wanted to confirm.

I would have preferred to add the cache IDs in DT similar to ACPI but I see
you have certain concerns with that which are valid as well.

I agree, probably architecture must do better job at defining these. But
generated IDs IMO might cause issues especial if we have to change the
logic without breaking the backward compatibility.

Not sure if we can call that *arbitrary* 😄, in that case we can imagine
the same at several places in the firmware.

IIRC, a note was added to avoid compaction if an implementation requires
any cache instance to be referenced uniquely.
