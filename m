Is perhaps the clearest description of the problem you want to solve.
It's clearly related to EFI though not the interface to the OS. IIRC,
"platform init" and "payload" are terms in the UEFI spec, right? I
don't recall how well defined those are vs. just abstract concepts.

Is it only for this interface or any firmware to firmware handoff. If
the former, then I'm looking for folks involved with EFI/Tianocore to
have some buy-in. If the latter, then this should be part of the
firmware handoff efforts and have buy-in there.

I really have limited knowledge and interest in this. I don't mind
hosting something like this in dtschema, but I'm not taking it without
buy-in from multiple parties which I haven't seen.
