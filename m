Without a crystal clear strategy, I think we're going to be tweaking
the algorithm forever as the _CRS/E820 mix changes.  That's why I
think that in the long term, a "use _CRS only, with quirks for
exceptions" strategy will be simplest.

So I think we should go ahead with DMI quirks instead of trying to
make the algorithm smarter, and yes, I think we will need commandline
arguments, probably one to force E820 clipping for future machines,
and one to disable it for old machines.

Right, I agree.  I'm guessing Chromebooks don't get tested with
Windows at all, so we don't even have that level of testing to help.

Yes.  We actually did try this
(https://git.kernel.org/linus/1af3c2e45e7a), but unfortunately we had
to revert it.  Even more unfortunately, the revert
(https://git.kernel.org/linus/5e52f1c5e85f) doesn't have any details
about what went wrong.
