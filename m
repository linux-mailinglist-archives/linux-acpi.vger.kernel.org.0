Like you said, _PLD is not Type-C specific. We can't limit it to any
specific device class. For example, I'm pretty ssure that sooner or
later we want to get this information in user space also with camera
sensors, and probable with a few other things as well.

I think the question here is, can we create a some kind of an
abstraction layer for the user space that exposes the device location
details in generic Linux specific way - so with ACPI it would utilise
the _PLD, and with DT something else (today AFAIK DT does not have
any way to describe locations of the devices). Maybe I'm wrong?

But if that is the question, then IMO the answer is: maybe one day,
but not today, and even if we one day can come up with something like
that, we still should expose the _PLD as ACPI specific information to
the user space as is.

Even if one day we have common sysfs attributes for all the devices
that contain the location of the device in some form, those attributes
will almost certainly have only a sub-set of the _PLD details, a
sub-set that works also with DT.
IMO the user space should always have access to all the necessary _PLD
details in their raw form if needed, even if those common device
location attributes exist - duplicated information or not. And debugfs
unfortunately is also not OK for that, because the user space needs to
be able to also rely on access to the additional details if needed.

We can limit the _PLD fields that we expose to the ones that we know
we need today (and probable should limit them to those), and we can of
course have a Kconfig option for the _PLD sysfs information if we want
to, but let's not start this by trying to figure out what kind of
abstraction we want for this. Right now we simply can not do that.

thanks,
