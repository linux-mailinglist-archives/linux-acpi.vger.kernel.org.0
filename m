Well, not quite.

->shutdown() is expected to be a lightweight operation also suitable
for kexec() and similar situations where ->poweroff() may not work.

That's correct.

4. Make Chromebooks call something like hibernation_platform_enter()
on S5 entries (including reboot).

This won't work for PCI devices though, only for devices in the ACPI
PM domain, so it is not sufficient in general.

It generally makes sense to do this, because ->shutdown() is sort of
analogous to ->remove() from the driver model perspective, so if it is
sufficient for you, please feel free to send a formal patch with that
change.

If you need to do that on a per-platform basis, I would go for option
4 above instead.

Not exactly.

Yes, it does (to me), but no, it is not sufficient to address the
problem at hand.

Yes, there are.  See option 4 above.

I think that it is the case.  Whoever had had any performance concerns
regarding this before is still going to have them.

That would be clunky IMV.

No worries.

Thanks!
