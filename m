Because, to me, it reads as if you can put extra stuff in here that will
be ignored if not "pointed to" by another property. The word
"meaningful" is what implies that you can.

If you wanna keep it, I would just go for what you said in this
response - that this property does not make devices into suppliers and
is only to mark existing suppliers as post-init. I think that rules out
putting other devices in there.

Aye, both items: and maxItems: need to lose a level of indent. That
said, its not actually restricting anything. I fixed it up locally and
you can put as many elements as you like into each phandle and it does
not care. Maybe Rob can tell what is going wrong there..

Yup, that is about right, although you snipped out the actual complaint.
