OK so the upl-custom node can do whatever it needs to. I imagine these
will include the memory descriptor attribute field, and other parts
that may be missing from the /reserved-memory DT node specification?

A UEFI OS must consume this information from the UEFI memory map, not
from the /reserved-memory nodes. So these nodes must either not be
visible to the OS at all, or carry an annotation that the OS must
ignore them.

Would it be possible to include a restriction in the DT schema that
these are only valid in the firmware boot phase?
