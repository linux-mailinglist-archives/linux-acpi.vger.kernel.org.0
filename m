Now that I've had a chance to take a look the spec seems to
unequivocally mandate the timeouts in "6.xx.1 Operation", where was
the per-protocol timeout implied?

Sure, no concern about validating assumptions in the library, but
leave control to the host.

"6.xx.1 Operation" says "If a single DOE instance supports multiple
data object protocols, system firmware/software is permitted to
interleave requests/responses with different data object protocols."

...although I must say I don't understand how system software tracks
which response belongs to which request if the transactions are
interleaved.

I think the workqueue proposal removes the need for pcie_doe_request,
but still allows for the possibility of interleaving requests.

...and hopefully that device is not part of an active interleave
otherwise a reset can take down "System RAM".

Ok, just searching for a name that implies symmetrical teardown
register/unregister, enable/disable, ... etc. init/deinit doesn't do
it for me.

I was thinking something like 'struct pcie_doe_object' pointers rather
than u32 arrays.

Aren't they more likely to get offsets wrong with u32 arrays rather
than data structures?

I'm specifically thinking of a mechanism that blocks pci-sysfs from
initiating config-cycles if a driver has claimed that range.

However, these MCTP to DOE tunnels that the SPDM presentation alluded
to make me nervous as there is no protocol to prevent an OS driver
agent and an MCTP agent from clobbering each other.

Yeah, the shorthand that X*HZ == "X seconds worth of jiffies" is just
something I picked up from other drivers not explicit documentation.

I don't think it's complex. I think it's simpler to rationalize than
this pattern of taking a lock and going to sleep with the lock held.
You can eliminate the lock completely if the only access to a given
DOE is a single dedicated kthread. There are other examples of this
single-thread protocol handler pattern in the kernel, like libsas SMP
protocol.

The DOE object format has dedicated space for type and length.

If anything the endian issue is more reason to have a proper data structure.

I was more thinking that the public interface is a protocol rather
than the raw DOE. So the library knows CDAT, SPDM, IDE... and drivers
never need to query the interface.

So this more of a question about where to draw the line of common code.

For example in the nfit driver there is usage of:

acpi_label_write()

...and:

acpi_evaluate_dsm()

...where the former abstracts the protocol and the latter is the raw
interface. Both can write to a label area, but only one is idiomatic.
