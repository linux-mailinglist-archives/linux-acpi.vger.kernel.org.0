We will be teaching every other OS or hypervisor about FF-A
communication regardless. So it's rather about if we want to do it
properly leveraging auto discovery mechanisms supported by FF-A or not.

Encoding firmware bits in ACPI/DT can be seen as an easy upstream path
in the shorter run. But when the ACPI/DT becomes overloaded with
information that has to be passed from firmware to the OS rather than
purely describing hardware to the OS, it's ABI maintainability becomes
complex. We are already dealing with DT ABI compatibility challenges
especially the forward compatibility, so let's not make it even worse
with firmware information that can be discovered automatically.

The other benefit of auto discovery is that platform enablement becomes
really smooth. Once the firmware starts supporting a particular feature
like TPM over FF-A then the OS can discover and support it.
