That's an odd statement. We do in fact have an ARM64 system that doesn't
fulfill the ECAM requirement and yet it successfully boots with ACPI.

Erm... we're discussing Linux patches. Why would it be inappropriate to

What makes you think you can simply remove this without breaking support
for all of the devices that currently rely on the quirks?

Can you clarify for me where I can find this public information? What
I've been able to find suggests that that SBSA-compliant systems would
typically run ACPI, but I can't find anything about SBSA compliance
being a prerequisite for booting a system with ACPI.

I can understand why someone might *wish* for that to always be true,
but it seems to be a bit far removed from reality.

We can already do that, but should that prevent us from making UEFI and
ACPI an alternative boot mechanism?

I don't understand why you keep insisting on this. The mailing lists are
where kernel patches are discussed, are they not?

Heh... you must have a very low opinion of the upstream kernel if you
think merging these 100 lines of code is going to wreck it.

And if you look at the patch, the bulk (95/109 lines) is actually in the
Tegra194 PCIe driver and only 14/109 lines are added to the MCFG quirks.
That's hardly the kind of change that's going to wreck the kernel.

Looking at the existing quirks table, there's evidently a number of
people that didn't get the memo. The issue seems to be fairly common,
yet for some reason you're singling out Tegra194.
