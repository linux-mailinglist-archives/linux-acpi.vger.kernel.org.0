I use CHI as an example because it's what I'm familiar with, and my 
involvement in cache stashing discussions has been in the context of Arm 
CMN interconnects which are CHI-based. Other folks who build their own 
interconnects may have different details of how exactly they support 
cache stashing, but the overall point is that the required IDs are 
typically going to boil down to some amount (likely around 8-16 bits or 
so) of address-like information in a system-specific format which can't 
be reasoned about beyond that.

I don't really see this being an opportunity for firmware to be any more 
broken than usual. Systems that support cache stashing will need to 
provide the correct hardware IDs for targetable caches via their 
firmware tables, which it seems that MPAM's notion of cache IDs will 
have to coexist with. Systems that do not support cache stashing may not 
even have a meaningful notion of hardware IDs for caches, and thus 
cannot be expected to provide any in firmware. Linux will need to cope 
with both situations.

Thanks,
Robin.
