We aren't handling overlapping today, so a queue of one and wait on access
to that would work fine.  Queuing is more likely to be about multiple protocols
sharing a DOE (where allowed) as I'm not seeing a need in any individual protocol
to queue lots of things up at once. You could queue a few things in CMA as they
aren't all dependent on each other (though the order matters for building the
measurements) but I'm not sure why you would.

I'll go with a resounding 'maybe' on that... I'm not sure I like that the
async path in the submitter could be waiting a very long time (if we think
anyone will actually do async...)  I'm probably missing something.

I wasn't really expecting you to take a shot, but if you have time, that
would be great. I've not looked at the auxiliary bus stuff yet.

Whilst I have a PoC up and running for SPDM, it's a bunch of dirty hacks and
I suspect that, even when cleaned up, it's going to keep me busy for a while.

Mostly I've developed a steadily growing hatred for the different ways in
which signatures can be stored and hand decoding records or digging in
openspdm to figure out what order and encoding things are in this time...

+1

I'm sure there will be some issues left :)
