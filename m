From a quick look at the ACPI spec, I didn't see conditions like "OSPM
must put PCI devices in D3hot before executing _OFF".  But obviously
there's *some* reason and I probably just missed it.

I'm not surprised; it doesn't seem like we really have the details
needed to get to a root cause yet.  I think what we really need is a
PCIe analyzer trace to see what happens when the device "falls off the
bus".
