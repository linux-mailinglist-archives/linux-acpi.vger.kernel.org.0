It's up to Linus in the end, but to echo what Hans already said: I guess
Linus stance in this case would be along the lines of "let's get back to
a known state, even if we known that state has problems as well". And
that state is the mainline release 6.4 . Sure, Greg picked this up for
stable, but apart from that things boil down to "we tried something in
6.5-rc1, it did work well, so let's revert this until we work our a
proper solution that can be applied in a later cycle, no harm done".

Some urgency is required, as (a) the patch made it into a stable release
(b) get closer to the end of the merge window and want to avoid last
minute changes.

I'd say: it would be best to resolve this now with a revert, then we
might even reach the next stable-rc release (Greg unusually releases
those on Mon/Tue/Wed) and thus the next stable release. But let's please
definitely resolve this this week in mainline before -rc6.
