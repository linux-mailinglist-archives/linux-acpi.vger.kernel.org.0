Right, so you wrote the buggy version. Should be.
readl(cxlm->mbox_regs + CXLDEV_MB_CAPS_OFFSET);

Admittedly, "MB" for mailbox isn't super obvious. I think you've convinced me to
rename these register definitions
s/MB/MBOX.

I'd prefer to keep the helpers for now as I do find them helpful, and so far
nobody else who has touched the code has complained. If you feel strongly, I
will change it.

Why not both?

I ran into this in fact going from version 0.7 to 1.0 of the spec. I did call
out the spec version to address this, but you're right. Section names can change
too in theory.

/*
 * CXL 2.0 8.2.8.4.3
 * Mailbox Capabilities Register
 */

Too much?
