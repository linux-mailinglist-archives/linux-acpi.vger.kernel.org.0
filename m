I'm not all that interested in supporting vendor defined DOE
shenanigans. There's more than enough published DOE protocols that the
kernel could limit its support to the known set. This is similar to
how ACPI DSMs are not generically supported, but when they appear in a
published specification the kernel may then grow the support. The
supported protocols could be limited to: CDAT, PCIe IDE, CXL
Compliance, etc...

Vendor specific DOE is in the same class as unfettered /dev/mem
access, first you need to disable the kernel's integrity and
confidentiality protections, and then you can do whatever you want. If
a vendor wants a DOE protocol supported in the "trusted" set they can
simply publish the specification and send the proper support patches.
