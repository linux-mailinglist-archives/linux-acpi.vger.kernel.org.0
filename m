Well, most platform today have CPUIDLE_CORE_CTXT set so the existing code
works as expected. It is this Qcom platform that doesn't set it and need
different behaviour. So based on their requirement for running stable
tree, the fixes tag can be added. In short yes it can be seen as a fix
if this new requirement is considered.

Sorry the main reason for trying to avoid is there are multiple patches
adding the initial support and there has been some code restructuring
around this. So it may need proper backporting based on the version.
I just want to avoid if there is no real requirement for that.
