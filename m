Hi Bjorn,

Thanks for looking at this.  I got a bit carried away in this description
with trying to show that we don't need an RCEC or software support for
one and that has made the description rather confused. Sorry about that!

The complete lack of any consistent diagram of the various options in any
of the related specs has lead me down more than one dead end trying to work
this out.  Looking at the specs today I'm increasingly convinced the
question of Hardware-Reduced vs normal doesn't matter.


Let me try proposing a brief replacement description:

"Root Complex integrate End Points (RCiEPs) are not found below a root port.
 (PCI Express Base Specification 4.0 1.3.2.3, 7.1 for topology)
 As such the error handling needs to perform actions on only the device, rather
 than walking the bus as is done for conventional EPs.

 In firmware-first error handling there is no need to directly access the
 Root Complex Event Collector (RCEC) as the firmware is responsible for all
 actions touching it.  The implementation of the RCEC device may not be compliant
 with the PCIe Spec as the OS does not access it during error handling.
 (RCEC defined in PCI Express Base Specification 4.0 1.3.4)

 (Can drop next bit if we drop the code)
 If kernel-first error handling is in use, handling AER errors for RCiEPs
 requires access to the RCEC they are associated with. Support for this
 is not included in this RFC due to a lack of available test platform."

In our configuration we only support firmware first.
For that we don't need dev->rcec to be set.

For our case, the OS should not in any way touch the RCEC (in fact, as far as I can
tell, it doesn't actually need to exist - and for some of our platforms it doesn't.
An impdef bit of hardware can do the same job.)

The information that could be read from the RCEC is provided
in a CPER record via GHESv2.  Confirmation that the OS has done everything
it needs to with the error is done via a handshake in the GHESv2 Error Status
Block.

Hence for the particular corner case we care about this code provides everything
necessary.  The stubs of RCEC support are there just to indicate how it
'might' fit with a model where the RCEC is needed to get information about
the error etc.  I'm more than happy to drop them and perhaps put in a comment
to put anyone needing them on the right track.

I put this statement around 'fully support in our case' here to indicate
that the 'partial initial support' in the title is actually sufficient
for some systems.

As mentioned above, I think I went down a dead end on this description.
I think the lack of need for an RCEC in firmware first handling is equally
valid in all Firmware first cases.

I can have a go at highlighting relevant spec entries, though its scattered
across the ACPI spec and UEFI spec.  Focusing just on the elements relevant
to RAS handling...

The very brief version is that in Hardware Reduced ACPI all error
information is gathered via a management processor (or firmware doing
the same job) and presented as a descriptive record. There is also
a generic handshake to acknowledge the error without needing anything
hardware specific.

My confusion lay around the non Hardware-Reduced case.  I'm not totally clear
on what happens in that path and don't have any hardware to look at.
So my assumption was that it used the HEST entries for PCIe Root Port
etc to identify where to find the error.  I now 'think' that isn't true
and it uses GHES records. If anyone can point me to a reference for this
flow that would be great.

HEST can also include GHESv2 entries as defined in ACPI 6.3, section 18.3.2.8
There error flow is the same for all GHESv2 error types:

"These are the steps the OS must take once detecting an error from a particular
GHESv2 error source:
•OSPM detects error (via interrupt/exception or polling the block status)
•OSPM copies the error status block
•OSPM clears the block status field of the error status block
•OSPM acknowledges the error via Read Ack register. For example:
—OSPM reads the Read Ack register  X
—OSPM writes  (( X & ReadAckPreserve) | ReadAckWrite)"

Referring back to the GHES description in ACPI 6.3 18.3.2.7
We have a Generic Error Status Block which has a bunch of
Generic Error Data Entries (18-392). Those contain CPER
records.

CPER record types are defined in the UEFI spec, appendix N.
These are identified by GUID and there is one for PCIE errors.
(table 54)  Definition of that is in N2.7.
It includes the source, plus root port / bridge address and
(potentially) a copy of the PCIe Advanced Error Reporting
Extended Capability Structure

Everything you might otherwise read from the AER registers should
be present in this record.  The basic aim being that you shouldn't
need to read those PCIe registers directly (and may not be able
to).

The only thing it really depends on is whether an RCEC is present.
It is possible to have a valid platform that doesn't need one.
The reference to firmware-first etc are about establishing that it
is optional.

Same info as above.  Good info on what firmware first flow actually means
is hard to come by.  I have docs on our flows, but can't find any on
a typical x86 machine.

You can't walk the bus for RCiEPs so its going to be inherently different.
We could do it as a series of special cases though so it's obvious what
is going on. Would you prefer that?

Side note on something we are not trying to support here for anyone who
comes across it! I shouldn't have left that in.  I'll drop it.

Agreed.  This code is operating on the RCiEP not the rcec. Only the
block below under the if (rcec) check touches that. 

It might help to think of this as walking a bus of one element. Hence
we are calling directly on the RCiEP rather than the bus walks in
the normal path.

Yes, and they are unless I'm missing something. Except for the one
block below, which mirrors the actions taken on the root port in the
normal path.

This is the only bit that related to the RCEC.

I'm happy to drop this. It's here only to try to make the point that the
infra-structure would be needed in the non Firmware-First case.

Intent was to illustrate that what I was defining for firmware first
would also work for kernel-first flows assuming someone actually put in place
infrastructure to hook up the RCEC here.

I was rather hoping someone would jump up and say 'I've got one of those!'.

Thanks again,

Jonathan
