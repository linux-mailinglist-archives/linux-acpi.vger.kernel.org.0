Agreed, it is the key point.

Per ACPI 6.5 18.1 Hardware Errors and Error Sources[1]:

	- An uncorrected error is a hardware error condition that cannot be
	corrected by the hardware or by the firmware. Uncorrected errors
	are either fatal or non-fatal.

	- A fatal hardware error is an uncorrected or uncontained error
	condition that is determined to be unrecoverable by the hardware.
	When a fatal uncorrected error occurs, the system is restarted to
	prevent propagation of the error.

	A non-fatal hardware error is an uncorrected error condition from
	which OSPM can attempt recovery by trying to correct the error.
	These are also referred to as correctable or recoverable errors.

Based on our discussion and the PCIe and APCI Spec:

- Native AER fatal error defined in PCIe does not indate that there's
uncontained data corruption.
- The kernel is capable of handle native AER fatal and non-fatal errors.
- When a CPER_SEV_FATAL error nofitied by firmware, it indicates the
platform wants to force the OS to restart, and the APEI/GHES driver follows
the Spec now.

(Please correct me if I misunderstand any)

So back to the original question, I think your above comments are clear enough.

If the system is reset in platform without even returning to the OS,
it is not visible to end user. IMHO, it always a bad choice.
The OS can provide enhanced debuggability, for example:

- providing details about the runtime context through crashdump
- saving error information to persistent storage

Thank you for your patience and valuable feedback. It is greatly appreciated
and truly helpful.

Best Regards and Cheers.
