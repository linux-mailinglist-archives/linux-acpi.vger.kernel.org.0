I think you are still getting mixed up with grub. Platform Init does
not necessarily provide EFI boot services, even for Tianocore. It is
the Payload which provides those services. In other words, the second
half of Tianocore does not use EFI boot services to talk to the first
half.

Yes, but please see the v4 or v5 patch version, where that has
changed. I sent v4 two days ago. I am worried that you are still
responding to something that I revised in response to your original
comments?

OK I stand corrected.

OK good. So with my binding that would be 'runtime-code@...'. I am
still not sure what the problem is here.

OK, so please help me get this resolved.
