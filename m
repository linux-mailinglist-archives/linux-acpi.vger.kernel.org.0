Why do you want to boot with "pcie_aspm=off"?  If we have to use a
PCI-related parameter to boot, something is already wrong, so if
there's a problem that requires ASPM to be disabled, we should fix
that first.

If there's a known hardware or firmware issue with ASPM, we should
quirk it so users don't have to discover this parameter.

Yes.  My question from that review is still open:

  But Rafael added ACPI_PCIE_REQ_SUPPORT with 415e12b23792 ("PCI/ACPI:
  Request _OSC control once for each root bridge (v3)") [1], apparently
  related to a bug [2].  I assume there was some reason for requiring
  all those things together, so I'd really like his comments.

  [1] https://git.kernel.org/linus/415e12b23792
  [2] https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20232

Rafael clearly said in [1] that we need to:

  ... check if all of the requisite _OSC support bits are set before
  calling acpi_pci_osc_control_set() for a given root complex.

We would still need to explain why Rafael thought all these _OSC
support bits were required, but now they're not.

_OSC does not negotiate directly for control of ASPM (though of course
it *does* negotiate for control of the PCIe Capability, which contains
the ASPM control bits), but the PCI Firmware spec, r3.3, sec 4.5.3, has
this comment in a sample _OSC implementation:

  // Only allow native hot plug control if the OS supports:
  // * ASPM
  // * Clock PM
  // * MSI/MSI-X

which matches the current ACPI_PCIE_REQ_SUPPORT.

So I think I would approach this by reworking the _OSC negotiation so
we always advertise "OSC_PCI_ASPM_SUPPORT | OSC_PCI_CLOCK_PM_SUPPORT"
if CONFIG_PCIEASPM=y.

Advertising support for ASPM doesn't mean Linux has to actually
*enable* it, so we could make a different mechanism to prevent use of
ASPM if we have a device or platform quirk or we're booting with
"pcie_aspm=off".
