Looking at the case in this patch as an example

Something like (completely untested)...
Note only real change here is having an extra pointer in mbox_cmd so we can 
have in and out buffers provided.  Doesn't change the flow at all means we can
use the internal memcpy_from_io memcpy_to_io in more cases.
Zero copy is still fine if we are in a case where it makes sense.

struct mbox_cmd {
	u16 opcode;
//separate in and out pointers.
	void *payload_in;
	void *payload_out;
	size_t size_in;
	size_t size_out;
	u16 return_code;
};

static int cxl_mem_mbox_send_cmd(struct cxl_mem *cxlm,
				 struct mbox_cmd *mbox_cmd)
{
	u64 cmd_reg, status_reg;
	size_t out_len;
	int rc;

	lockdep_assert_held(&cxlm->mbox.mutex);

	/*
	 * Here are the steps from 8.2.8.4 of the CXL 2.0 spec.
	 *   1. Caller reads MB Control Register to verify doorbell is clear
	 *   2. Caller writes Command Register
	 *   3. Caller writes Command Payload Registers if input payload is non-empty
	 *   4. Caller writes MB Control Register to set doorbell
	 *   5. Caller either polls for doorbell to be clear or waits for interrupt if configured
	 *   6. Caller reads MB Status Register to fetch Return code
	 *   7. If command successful, Caller reads Command Register to get Payload Length
	 *   8. If output payload is non-empty, host reads Command Payload Registers
