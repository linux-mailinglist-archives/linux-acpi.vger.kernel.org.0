At a glance this description makes sense, but the logic in 
pci_target_state() already accounts for finding the matching states that 
PME can be generated from.

 From one of these systems this is the problematic root port:

pci 0000:00:08.3: PME# supported from D0 D3hot D3cold

It's accurate while the system isn't in the deepest state too.
If I rmmod amd-pmc or unbind it then the platform will never be notified 
that the OS said it can go to the deepest state at suspend.

With no changes to the kernel pressing a key on the keyboard works and 
you can see the IRQ that woke the system matches the PCIe PME.

I think what we're at here is likely an unspecified platform behavior 
that is "masked" in Windows due to the way that policy works in Windows 
(constraints will influence what states are selected for integrated 
devices by the uPEP driver).

I'm going to drop my updated series to the mailing list that adds the 
ability for a driver to register a vote like Hans suggested and we can 
see what everyone thinks.
