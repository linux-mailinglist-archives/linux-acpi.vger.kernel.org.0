Correct. I believe what is being described by the firmware is a fixed
read-only property describing the location of the device ("external")
- not what to do with it ("untrusted").

Correct. Since the firmware is actually describing the unchangeable
topology (and not the policy), the takeaway I am taking from this
discussion is that the flag should be called "external".

Like I said, I don't have any hard opinions on this. So if you feel
that my conclusion is wrong and consensus was the other way around
("untrusted"), let me know and I'll be happy to change this.

Thanks,
