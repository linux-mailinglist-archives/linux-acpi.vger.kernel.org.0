Since this came from you, Zhiqiang, it needs a signed-off-by (not just
a reviewed-by) from you.  See
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst?id=v5.11#n361

and

  - Wrap commit log to fill 80 columns
  - s/pci/PCI/ (subject and commit log)
  - Run "git log --oneline drivers/pci/hotplug/acpiphp_glue.c".  It's
    not completely consistent, but at least match the style of one of
    them.

There is no "pci_device" structure.  I think you mean the "struct
pci_dev".

The commit log doesn't actually say what the patch does.  It's obvious
from the patch, but it should say in the commit log.  Look at previous
commit logs to see how they do it.
