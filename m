After our thread and the spec again I think you're right Linux doesn't 
natively comprehend (reserve this region;) particularly because of the 
stance you have on "static table" vs _CRS.

I just don't want to throw the vendor under the bus as it could have 
been caught "sooner" and fixed by BIOS adding _CRS.

I'll share the full dmesg below just redacting the DMI information.

In that sense the only reason this works on the AMD reference platform 
is because that region happens to have been reserved from a subset of 
another region.

Per the stance on "static table", we should advocate for _CRS to be 
populated with MCFG on AMD reference platform too, right?

Reading your stance it makes sense more of why we're where we are now.

Let me ask though - why does the distinction of old OS vs new OS matter?
If a vendor wants it to work with a kernel that didn't use MCFG to make 
a reservation _CRS or some other overlapping reservation is their only 
option.

But if we changed this behavior in a newer kernel then the stance can be
something like:
"upstream kernel 6.8 or newer will reserve MCFG if not specified by _CRS 
or any other overlapping reservation"
and
"upstream kernel 6.7 or older require explicit reservations".

It seems to me that this type of issue would entirely go away in most 
cases and it would satisfy the spec note about
'natively comprehend' reserving the MMCFG region.
