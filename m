OK, so if I understand correctly, you're using Interrupt Link devices
not because it's possible to connect a PCI interrupt to one of several
inputs on the interrupt controller, but because the PCI default of
"level triggered, active low" is not compatible with GICv2.

The Interrupt Link device gives you a chance to specify "level
triggered, active *high*".  If you used a Source of 0 (where there
is no Interrupt Link), there would be no way to specify that.

Since this use of Interrupt Links only conveys triggering information
and nothing is configurable, I think the OS should get that info from
_CRS, and _PRS and _SRS should not be required.

Alex made a change [1] along that line a while ago, but maybe there's
more we should do.
