...but there's a pile of stuff in the component registers that the
kernel will never care about. So if the bar is "remove when all
capabilities are mapped" then the TODO never gets removed.

Seems premature to assume this code path would be reused for 1.1, also
CXL 1.1 also puts version1 here. The difference between 1.1 and 2.0
component registers is more potential capability ids, not a different
capability version number if I'm reading the specs correctly.

No, per above, I still don't think this is adding any value.

The issue is that this is a struct entry with no description of the
members. I ended up doing this for device registers:

/*
 * CXL_DEVICE_REGS - Common set of CXL Device register block base pointers
 * @status: CXL 2.0 8.2.8.3 Device Status Registers
 * @mbox: CXL 2.0 8.2.8.4 Mailbox Registers
 * @memdev: CXL 2.0 8.2.8.5 Memory Device Registers
 */
#define CXL_DEVICE_REGS() \
        void __iomem *status; \
        void __iomem *mbox; \
        void __iomem *memdev

/* See note for 'struct cxl_regs' for the rationale of this organization */
struct cxl_device_regs {
        CXL_DEVICE_REGS();
};

...i.e. just abandon kernel-doc for this organization, but this might
be more evidence that this arrangement is more clever than its worth.

I'm not seeing much register block type support being added in the
near term beyond HDMs.

It just feels like the helpers here are too tiny to provide any
significant cleanup.

I'm open to better naming, but not __func() wrapping func().
