What we as developers put into mainline kernel Kconfig files has nothing
to do with what distros use in their distro config files.
Or at least it shouldn't.  Maybe your experience has been different.

Hm, it's not in coding-style AFAICT but Linus has OK-ed C99 style comments:

Sure, MAINTAINERS is fine, but the MODULE_AUTHOR() above provides
no useful information.
Even saying (made up) linux-devel@linux.intel.com would be slightly better,
but some kind of contact info would be great. Otherwise just delete that line.
