Ah!  That makes sense now, thank you!  So this is merely an example of
a newer machine for which 4dc2287c1805 is important.  It's not a case
where *this* patch is relevant.

I think having the entire root bridge window covered by an EFI MMIO
entry is not actually a problem per spec.  My previous response to the
log message applies:

The problem is only that Linux doesn't handle this correctly because
of 4dc2287c1805, which makes it think the entire window is
unavailable.

It does, it was very helpful, thanks!

I have an alternate proposal which does basically the same thing
(skipping the 4dc2287c1805 workaround when an E820 entry covers the
entire window), but I think it's slightly simpler.

And more importantly, it adds a little bit of logging and updates the
window itself instead of clipping on every alloc, which I should have
done in 4dc2287c1805 from the beginning, and should make issues easier
to debug.

I'll post it shortly.
