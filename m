This means that acpi_os_map_memory() will always map the area  as PROT_DEVICE_nGnRnE, which results in an alignment fault on an unaligned access. For some reason this does not fail on some implementations.

Yes this should be fixed. I put together a patch that I needed to post,
below.

Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: osl: Fix BERT error region memory mapping

Currently the sysfs interface maps the BERT error region as "memory"
(through acpi_os_map_memory()) in order to copy the error records into
memory buffers through memory operations (eg memory_read_from_buffer()).

The OS system cannot detect whether the BERT error region is part of
system RAM or it is "device memory" (eg BMC memory) and therefore it
cannot detect which memory attributes the bus to memory support (and
corresponding kernel mapping, unless firmware provides the required
information).

The acpi_os_map_memory() arch backend implementation determines the
mapping attributes. On arm64, if the BERT error region is not present in
the EFI memory map, the error region is mapped as device-nGnRnE; this
triggers alignment faults since memcpy unaligned accesses are not
allowed in device-nGnRnE regions.

The ACPI sysfs code cannot therefore map by default the BERT error
region with memory semantics but should use a safer default.

Change the sysfs code to map the BERT error region as MMIO (through
acpi_os_map_iomem()) and use the memcpy_fromio() interface to read the
error region into the kernel buffer.
