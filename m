How do I submit it for dtschema?

I think I understand your question. This property can be relevant for
any device -- it really depends on the device's consumers and
suppliers and if they form a cycle. Ideally, we can check if a device
is in a cycle and then allow it only for those, but that's going to be
too complicated I think. So, I think this should be allowed for any
device.

Since this property is defined as a "post-init-supplier" and only
applies to an existing direct supplier, there's not a lot of room for
misuse. Actually if you can add a check "are all the phandles listed
in this property also present in one of the other properties in this
device node", that should be sufficient.

I'll also edit the documentation to make it clear it's meaningful only
for an existing supplier.

Oops... didn't edit out all the lines in the example.

I'll address all your other comments in the next patch.

Btw, this is the command I used to validate this file (before I sent
v1), but it didn't spit out anything meaningful that I could
understand:

make dt_binding_check DT_CHECKER_FLAGS=3D-m
DT_SCHEMA_FILES=3DDocumentation/devicetree/bindings/trivial-devices.yaml

Is that the right way to run it? I'm using yamllint 1.32. So it's not
terribly old either (can't install anything newer).
