Actually, this is for consumption by firmware. The goal is to allow
edk2 to boot into U-Boot and vice versa, i.e. provide some
interoperability between firmware projects. I will use the "Platform
Init" and "Payload" terminology here too.

There is no intent to implement the UEFI spec, here. It is simply that
some payloads (EDK2) are used to having this information.

Imagine splitting EDK2 into two parts, one of which does platform init
and the other which (the payload) boots the OS. The payload wants
information from Platform Init and it needs to be in a devicetree,
since that is what we have chosen for this interface. So to some
extent this is unrelated to whether you have EFI boot services. We
just need to be able to pass the information across the interface.
Note that the user can (without recompilation, etc.) replace the
second part with U-Boot (for example) and it must still work.

That seems to me to be the fields from the EFI memory-map call, but
where is the actual content? I looked in the kernel but it seems to be
an internal interface (between the stub and the kernel)?

Here I believe you are talking about booting the kernel in EFI mode,
but that is not the intent of this patch. This is all about things
happening in firmware. Now, if the payload (second) part of the
firmware decides it wants to offer EFI boot services and boot the
kernel via the EFI stub, then it may very well pack this information
(with a few changes) into a system table and make it available to the
kernel stub. But by then this FDT binding is irrelevant, since it has
served its purpose (which, to reiterate, is to facilitate information
passage from platform init to 'payload').
