I do not understand this response, sorry.

So you have a new way of matching drivers to devices?  That's odd.

This is kernel code, it is always "forever", sorry.

If you want "minor to minor" update, how is that going to work given
that you do not add changes only to "minor" releases (that being the
6.12.y the "y" number).

Remember, Linux does not use "semantic versioning" as its release
numbering is older than that scheme.  It just does "this version is
newer than that version" and that's it.  You can't really take anything
else from the number.

And if this isn't for "upstream" at all, then why have it?  We can't add
new features and support it if we can't actually use it and it's only
for out-of-tree vendor kernels.

And how will you document properly a "well defined forward path"?  That
should be done first, before you have any code here that we are
reviewing.

Please do that, get people to agree on the idea and how it will work
before asking us to review code.

thanks,

greg k-h
