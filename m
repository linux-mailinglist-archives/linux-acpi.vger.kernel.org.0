I don't have a say about this anymore, so this is only a passing
comment, which you are free to cast aside.

My personal view is that if you need to rely on core_initcall() for a
particular firmware interface, then your architecture will end-up
being an unmaintainable ball of hacks, with conflicting requirements
and increasingly diverging behaviours. Those who had the 'privilege'
to deal with the 32bit ARM transition to DT will understand what I
mean.

Having to rely on initcalls can only mean two things:

- you're missing crucial topology information that will eventually
  bite you where it hurts, and you're better off going back to the
  drawing board to fix it before any HW ships,

- you're not making use of the kernel's dependency management
  infrastructure, which is pretty sad. Yes, it is DT specific for now,
  but nothing prevents you from improving it to make it grok another
  firmware interface.

But as I said, I don't have much skin in that game anymore.
