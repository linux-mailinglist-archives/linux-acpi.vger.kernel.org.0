I don't understand what this means.

UEFI specifies how one component invokes another, and it is not based
on a DT binding. If the second component calls UEFI boot or runtime
services, it should be invoked in this manner. If it doesn't, then it
doesn't care about these memory reservations (and the OS will not be
booted via UEFI either)

So I feel I am missing something here. Perhaps a practical example
would be helpful?

Platform init can communicate memory reservations to a UEFI payload if
needed, and there is prior art for this.

Platform init *cannot* communicate UEFI specific boot or runtime
reservations in this manner, as this doesn't make sense: either
Platform Init is UEFI and invokes a UEFI payload, in which case the
UEFI spec applies. In other cases, the UEFI memory regions either
don't exist or are irrelevant. The only EFI-agnostic aspect here is
RAM reservation for use by firmware in general, and this does not have
these UEFI semantics and does not need to be framed as such.
