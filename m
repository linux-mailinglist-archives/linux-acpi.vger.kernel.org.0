That's not an assumption so much as a statement of intent. And really 
it's the other way round anyway, as a reminder that this replay call is 
only still here (unlike in the ACPI path) because there *is* still 
plenty of sketchy usage of of_dma_configure() which I'm wary of breaking.

I didn't mean the explicit power management links created by the SMMU 
driver itself, I meant the fwnode links created automatically by 
fw_devlink_link_device() at device_add() time, which infer a 
supplier-consumer relationship from the "iommus" DT property, wherein 
device_links_check_suppliers() would then defer the GPU driver probe 
until the SMMU driver probe has completed successfully probing and 
called device_links_driver_bound().

Except it turns out that "iommus" is one of the optional properties 
which are only linked that way under "fw_devlink=strict", so that 
explains that, fair enough.

Well, tightening up __iommu_probe_device() would stand to slightly 
reduce the window in general while bus_set_iommu() is running. However 
you're right that this is a different race from the ones implicated 
there. I have now managed to provoke it on my Juno board with 
"driver_async_probe=*" (which does also require that patch for other 
reasons), and I think I've got a reasonable fix which I shall finish 
writing up and send shortly. Thanks for helping me nail this one down!

Cheers,
Robin.
