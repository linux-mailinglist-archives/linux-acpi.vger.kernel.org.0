Can we tease this apart a little more?  Linux doesn't program all the
bits that control error signaling, so even on hardware that works
perfectly, much of this behavior is determined by what firmware did.
I wonder if Linux could be more careful about this.

"Bus abort" is not a term used in PCIe.  IIUC, a config read to a
device that doesn't exist should terminate with an Unsupported Request
completion, e.g., see the implementation note in PCIe r5.0 sec 2.3.1.

The UR should be an uncorrectable non-fatal error (Table 6-5), and
Figures 6-2 and 6-3 show how it should be handled and when it should
be signaled as a system error.  In case you don't have a copy of the
spec, I extracted those two figures and put them at [1].

Can you collect "lspci -vvxxx" output to see if we can correlate it
with those figures and the behavior you see?

As I'm sure you've noticed, controllers that support only 32-bit
config writes are not spec compliant and devices may not work
correctly.  The comment in pci_generic_config_write32() explains why.

You may not trip over this problem frequently, but I wouldn't call it
a "minor" issue because when you *do* trip over it, you have no
indication that a register was corrupted.

Even ECAM compliance is not really minor -- if this controller were
fully compliant with the spec, you would need ZERO Linux changes to
support it.  Every quirk like this means additional maintenance
burden, and it's not just a one-time thing.  It means old kernels that
*should* "just work" on your system will not work unless somebody
backports the quirk.
