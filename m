My understanding is that native comprehension would mean Linux knows
how to discover and/or configure the MMCFG base address and size in
the hardware and that Linux would then reserve that region so it's not
used for anything else.

Linux doesn't have that, at least for x86.  It relies on the MCFG
table to discover the MMCFG region, and it relies on PNP0C02 _CRS to
reserve it.

Is there a problem report we can reference here?

Does the problem still occur with this series?
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20231121183643.249006-1-helgaas@kernel.org

This appeared in linux-next 20231130.

I would love to know AMD BIOS team's take on this.  Does the BIOS
reserve the MMCFG space in any way?

Many of the MMCFG checks in Linux are historical artifacts that are
likely related to Linux defects, not BIOS defects, so I wouldn't
expect to see them in Windows.  But it's hard to remove them now.

I think this leads to using the MMCONFIG area without reserving it
anywhere, so we may end up assigning that space to something else,
which won't work, i.e., the problem described here:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/pci/pci.git/commit/?id=5cef3014e02d
