So how are you going to "version" these GUID?  I see you use "schema Vx"
above, but how is that really going to work in the end?  Lots of data
structures change underneath the base driver that it knows nothing
about, not to mention basic things like compiler flags and the like
(think about how we have changed things for spectre issues over the
years...)

And when can you delete an old "schema"?  This feels like you are
forcing future developers to maintain things "for forever"...
