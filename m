This already helps quite a lot, thanks.

But why should a non-UEFI OS be required to keep boot* or runtime*
regions reserved? The firmware stage that boots the OS knows whether
it is performing an UEFI boot or a non-UEFI boot, and it should only
present the information that goes along with that. The OS should never
have to worry about reconciling two sources of truth.

And to Rob's point about boot / runtime being ill-defined: I would
argue that 'runtime' quite clearly implies 'under the OS', and so UEFI
runtime* reservations are assumed to always be relevant to UEFI OSes.

I think there is a fundamental difference of opinion here, where the
position of the firmware developers is that the DT should be the same
across all boot stages, while my position reasoning from the OS side
is that the OS should be able to observe only the abstractions that
are part of the contract between firmware and OS.
