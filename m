Ok, for v5 I will replace this with your info on the specs from this email:

Ok, that works for me, I'll use the above text for v5.

no_e820 will be the default for BIOS-year >= 2018, but on older
systems my patch preserves the old behavior of use_e820.

So to allow people to easily test if no_e820 behavior helps on
older systems we need it.

I fully agree with your worry about 'misinformation as a "fix"
on random forums', but I don't have a solution for that.

I guess we could completely omit both cmdline options, but
that will make debugging issues a lot header. IMHO it is
worthwhile to have this options to allow users to quickly
test things when we ask them to do so.

Already fixed in v4 (the only change in v4). I'll also drop the "Windows..."
sentence which you did not like in the commit msg for v5.

This code runs early on, before the heuristics which set
pci_use_e820 gets set based on the BIOS year, so this is
done indirectly so that the code doing the heuristics
(and checking DMI quirks/exceptions if we add any)
can set a default and then these flags are checked to
override the default.

What I wrote above, also applies to the use_crs handling, which is
handled the same for the same reason :)
