Incidentally, "PCIe" is the abbreviation used in the PCIe specs, so I
try to use that instead of "PCIE" in drivers/pci/.

IIUC all these CXL devices will be enumerated by the PCI core.  They
seem to have regular PCI BARs (separate from the HDM stuff), so the
PCI core will presumably manage address allocation for them.  It looks
like Function Level Reset and hotplug are supposed to use the regular
PCIe code.  I guess this will all be visible via lspci just like
regular PCI devices, right?

It looks like you add a cxl_port for each ACPI0016 device and every
PCIe Root Port below it.  So I guess the upper level spanning is at a
higher level than cxl_port?

When we do FLR on the PCIe device, what happens to these CXL clients?
Do they care?  Are they notified?  Do they need to do anything before
or after the FLR?

What about hotplug?  Spec says it leverages PCIe hotplug, but it looks
like maybe this all requires ACPI hotplug (acpiphp) for adding
ACPI0017 devices and notifying of hot remove requests?  If it uses
PCIe native hotplug (pciehp), what connects the CXL side to the PCI
side?

I guess the HDM address space management is entirely outside the scope
of PCI -- the address space is not described by the CXL host bridge
_CRS and not described by CXL endpoint BARs?  Where *is* it described
and who manages and allocates it?  I guess any transaction routing
through the CXL fabric for HDM space is also completely outside the
scope of PCI -- we don't need to worry about managing PCI-to-PCI
bridge windows, for instance?

Is there a cxl_register_driver() or something?  I assume there will be
drivers that need to manage CXL devices?  Or will they use
pci_register_driver() and search for a CXL capability?

Thanks, we might be able to use that for portdrv.  I added it to my
list to investigate.

Well, I'm thinking about things like enumeration, hotplug, reset,
resource management (BARs, bridge windows, etc), interrupts, power
management (suspend, resume, etc), and error reporting.  These are all
things that PCIe defines on a per-Function basis and seem kind of hard
to cleanly subdivide.

Is "auxiliary-bus" a specific thing?  I'm not familiar with it but
again I'd like to read up on it in case it has ideas we could
leverage.

Sub-drivers *is* an issue for PCI in general, although mostly I think
it tends to be historical devices where people made the design mistake
of putting several unrelated pieces of functionality in the same PCI
function, so I don't think PCI has good infrastructure for doing that.
