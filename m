Agree that these are two separate attributes, and better not mixed.

The genesis is due to lack of a mechanism to establish if the device 
is trusted or not was the due lack of some specs and implementation around
Component Measurement And Authentication (CMA). Treating external as
untrusted was the best first effort. i.e trust internal 
devices and don't trust external devices for enabling ATS.

But that said external is just describing topology, and if Linux wants to
use that in the policy that's different. Some day external device may also
use CMA to estabilish trust. FWIW even internal devices aren't trust
worthy, except maybe RCIEP's.
