Yah, I think its intentional, unless i'm missing something. The hisi 
quirk detection path forces this off regardless of the user attempting 
to force it on. Which is part of why I think the enum states must be as 
above. The other reason is that the final result of whether FIE is 
disabled ends up in /sys/modules/cppc_cpufreq/parameters/fie_disabled 
which in this case may not reflect what the user requested.


I have another patch that might be worth posting that I created while 
implementing CPPC on a machine a year or so ago that removes this quirk 
entirely. Instead it detects counters that aren't incrementing properly 
and NULL's out the get routine so that cpupower/etc report that the 
frequency is being retrieved from the kernel rather than the hardware. 
Someone else will have to test it though, because I eventually figured 
out how to synthesize both counters in a way that is generic enough to 
work on most machines.
