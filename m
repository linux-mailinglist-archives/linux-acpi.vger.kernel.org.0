The TPM event log is rather something that the firmware should propogate
to the OS rather than the TPM itself. The standard way for firmware to
pass that on is via UEFI [1] but still for non-UEFI compatible platforms
it gets propogated via ACPI/DT from the firmware. As UEFI gets adopted
further in embedded space, the reliance on ACPI/DT will reduce.

You are considering ACPI at this point but when people want to use this
TPM over FF-A on a platform using DT then it will require corresponding
DT bindings. After that each platform has to enable TPM over FF-A in
their corresponding ACPI/DT. All that won't be needed with auto
discovery over FF-A.

We don't need to pass event log over FF-A as UEFI interface is already
there. And we are already adding support for start method over FF-A, so
all I am asking is what significant effort do you see with discovering CRB
pysical address over FF-A.
