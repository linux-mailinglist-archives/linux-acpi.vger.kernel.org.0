I thought about that and in order to keep consistency it is better to
keep the platform device model, so please resend the latest version
platform device based and I will ACK it (hopefully it is not too late
for v5.18).

Please note before resending it that sdei_event_unregister() requires a
retry loop since it can return -EINPROGRESS (see sdei_unregister_ghes()).

Thanks,
Lorenzo
