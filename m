That would work but I thought was ruled out as an approach.
@Bjorn would this be acceptable?

True for specific protocols (CDAT). I'm fairly sure, with IDE you can take down
the link encryption to the device, potentially (worst case?) resulting a memory
access failure and a machine reboot or corruption of persistent memory.

The short answer is that lock requirement, in the above note, rules
out safe direct userspace use of the DOE (unless we can tell the kernel
is not going to ever use it).  Mediation must be done. Even if we safely
protect the kernel side via aborts, userspace transactions can be
interrupted in a fashion that is invisible to userspace (beyond maybe
a timeout if the userspace code is hardened against this). So there is no
legitimate use that is not fully mediated by the kernel. So ioctl
or defined per protocol interfaces are the way forwards.

Perhaps that's putting it rather strongly :)
