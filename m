If you want people to look at and care about your changes, it is never
a waste of time to explain them.

It's helpful to your reviewers if you include a note about changes
between v2 and v3, as you did in your v2 0/2 cover letter.

It's also helpful if you thread the series with patches 1 and 2 as
responses to the cover letter.  That makes it easy to download the
patches using b4.  Here's a little more background:
