No, the patch is not applied to Ubuntu kernels, Someone set it to 
committed by a mistake, and the bug status was changed back to confirmed 
already.

I reread the dmesg today, found all pci root bridges have at least one 
iomem window which is not overlapped with e820 reserved region, that is 
to say, in theory my patch will not assign new iomem window for any pci 
root bridges. So I don't know how my patch introduces the crashing on 
that machine.

The e820 entry prevent the pci devices from getting the overlapped 
region by the path below:

kernel/resource.c:__find_resource()--->arch/x86/kernel/resource.c:arch_remove_reservations()--->remove_e820_regions()

Maybe we could remove arch_remove_reservations() as other architectures?
