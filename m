It's not "lost"; I assume the root port raises an error because it
can't send a transaction over a link that is down.

Is "SERROR" an ARM64 thing?  My guess is the root port would raise an
Unsupported Request error or similar, and the root complex turns that
into a system-specific SERROR?

Wrap this and comment below to fit in 80 columns.  Nothing magic about
80 columns except for the fact that all the other code in drivers/pci
fits in that width and consistency is helpful.

This doesn't seem to fit in an MCFG quirk.

Is the crash because SERROR is fundamentally unrecoverable?  Is there
any control over what kind of system-specific error the PCIe errors
are mapped to?

I know there are other systems where PCIe errors always cause a system
crash, but most platforms seem to be moving toward at least the
theoretical ability to recover from I/O errors.
