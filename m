A driver name can NEVER be an abi, please don't do that.

That's crazy, who is going to be adding all of that to all drivers?  And
knowing to bump this if the internal data representaion changes?  And it
will change underneath it without the driver even knowing?  This feels
really really wrong, unless I'm missing something.

What "core" is doing this?  And how exactly?

And why is PCI somehow special here?

How do you reset a device you are not bound to?  That feels ripe for
causing problems (think multi-function devices...)

And what about PCI drivers that are really just a aux-bus "root" point?
How is the sharing of all of the child devices going to work?

This feels really rough and might possibly work if you squint hard
enough and test it in a very limited way with almost no real hardware :)

good luck!
