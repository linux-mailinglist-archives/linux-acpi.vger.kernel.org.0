ACPI_PCIE_REQ_SUPPORT was introduced with 415e12b23792 ("PCI/ACPI:
Request _OSC control once for each root bridge (v3)") in 2011.
It's linked to the following bug report:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20232

I can't say whether there's a chance that the proposed patch would
bring back the issue discussed at that time.

If somebody thinks that the proposed patch isn't the right solution,
then presumably the following needs to be touched.

	if ((support & ACPI_PCIE_REQ_SUPPORT) != ACPI_PCIE_REQ_SUPPORT) {
		decode_osc_support(root, "not requesting OS control; OS requires",
				   ACPI_PCIE_REQ_SUPPORT);
		return;
	}

	control = OSC_PCI_EXPRESS_CAPABILITY_CONTROL
		| OSC_PCI_EXPRESS_PME_CONTROL;
