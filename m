Today Linux does that by passing:

  /chosen/linux,uefi-mmap-start
  /chosen/linux,uefi-mmap-size
  /chosen/linux,uefi-mmap-desc-size
  /chosen/linux,uefi-mmap-desc-ver

... or /chosen/xen,* variants of those.

Can't we document / genericise that?

Pointing to that rather than re-encoding it in DT means that it stays in-sync
with the EFI spec and we won't back ourselves into a corner where we cannot
encode something due to a structural difference. I don't think it's a good idea
to try to re-encode it, or we're just setting ourselves up for futher pain.

Thanks,
Mark.
