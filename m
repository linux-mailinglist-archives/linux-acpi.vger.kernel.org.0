It seems like you are thinking of the Payload as grub, or something
like that? This is not about grub. If there are EFI boot services to
be provided, they are provided by the Payload, not Platform Init. I am
not that familiar with Tianocore, but if you are, perhaps think of it
as splitting Tianocore into two pieces, one of which inits the silicon
and the other which provides the EFI boot services.

Again, if you are familiar with Tianocore, it can be built either as a
monolithic whole, or as a coreboot Payload. The Payload part of the
code is (roughly) the same in each case. But the Platform Init is
different[1]

It really is purely so we can mix and match Platform Init (perhaps
silicon init is a more familiar term?) and the Payload.

Simon

[1] Of course, coreboot uses blobs which are chunks of UEFI, but that
is a separate issue
