Sure, but the PCI power management framework doesn't need to know
about PCI/PCIe differences.

This is compatible with conventional PCI behavior.  PME_Support in the
PM Capability tells us whether the device can generate a PME from D0,
D1, D2, D3hot, or D3cold.  AFAIK, this applies to both conventional
PCI and PCIe, so I think this _DSD must be telling us something more
than just "this PCIe device can assert PME from D3hot and D3cold."

PME_Support tells us whether the device can generate PMEs from D3cold,
but of course it doesn't say anything about whether hotplug events
cause those PMEs.

PCIe r5.0, sec 6.7.3.4, says ports must support PMEs for hotplug
events while the device is in D1, D2, or D3hot.  It clearly leaves out
D3cold.

So maybe this _DSD tells us that this device can generate *hotplug*
event PMEs from D3cold?

Yes, transitions to/from D3cold require platform support.  But those
transitions are done by ACPI methods, so any plumbing is ACPI's
problem, and I don't think this _DSD helps the OS with that.

That doesn't really help fix bugs in this area or help with future
refactoring, because it's not specific about what the issues were or
what the _DSD means.

I think the combination of PCIe r5.0 7.5.2.1 (PME_Support from D0, D1,
D2, D3hot, D3cold) and 6.7.3.4 (hotplug PME events from D1, D2,
D3hot) covers everything except hotplug PME events from D3cold.

So my guess is that this _DSD is a way to tell the OS that this device
generates PMEs for hotplug events even when the device is in D3cold.
Does that make any sense?

The problem I'm trying to solve is making this code understandable.
It doesn't help to assert that "there are no devices that exercise
this path" because one cannot figure that out by looking at the code.

That's a much better idea, thank you!  I'll cc you when I revise the
patch.
