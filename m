Hi Bjorn,

Thanks for reviewing. I’ll try to fix all existing issues and send a new
version later.

According to my understanding, does it mean to add something like：

+       capbuf[OSC_SUPPORT_DWORD] |= OSC_SB_INTR_RS_SUPPORT;

and check whether the platform supports usage of ResourceSource after
acpi_run_osc() returns successfully:

+		osc_sb_intr_rs_support_confirmed =
+			capbuf_ret[OSC_SUPPORT_DWORD] & OSC_SB_INTR_RS_SUPPORT;

with this bool value, we can then determine if we would ignore the
ResourceSource field later.

Or we just advertise this capability from the OS side without introducing
the ‘osc_sb_intr_rs_support_confirmed’?

I am not certain about it because:

1) If we strictly flow the spec, which says “the platform will indicate to
OS whether ... If not set, the OS may choose to ignore the ResourceSource
parameter in the extended interrupt descirptor”, this means this capability
can be used to determine whether we would ignore to parse the field later.

2) On the other hand, Since the ResourceSource has already been used to
create hierarchical domain for platform device (introduced by 621dc2fdcea1)
and previous driver does not check this capability, I am not sure whether
it would break the existing platforms. 

Fix me if I am wrong.

Cheers,

Chen Baozi.
