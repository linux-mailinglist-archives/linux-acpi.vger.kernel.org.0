OK, great.  IIUC, that means this function doesn't need to be in
drivers/pci and it could be moved to the NVMe code.

Is pdev->bridge_d3 really needed before pci_device_add()?  It would be
really nice if there were a way to get rid of that manual lookup of
the companion device in acpi_pci_bridge_d3().
