[I see that you just posted a v12 that doesn't touch drivers/pci at
all.  I haven't looked at it yet, so maybe my questions/comments below
are no longer relevant.]

OK, help me out because I think I have a hint of how this works, but
I'm still really confused.  Here's the sort of commit log I envision
(but I know it's all wrong, so help me out):

  Iain reported that the Lenovo Thinkpad Z13 suspends but activity on
  plugged-in USB devices will not cause a resume.  The resume failed
  because the Root Port leading to the USB adapter was in D3hot, and
  ... maybe firmware can't identify the wakeup source?  I dunno?

  The Z13 supplies an ACPI PNP0D80 System Power Management Controller
  with a "Get Device Constraints" _DSM method that says the Root Port
  should not be put into a lower power state than D0 ??

[This is one thing that seems completely wrong.  The _DSM spec says
the device must be in the specified or DEEPER D-state to achieve the
lowest power platform idle state.  That seems backwards.]

  For power-manageable devices (those with _PS0 or _PR0, per ACPI
  r6.5, sec 7.3), platform_pci_choose_state() selects the low-power
  state based on the device's _SxW, _SxD, and _PRW methods.

  For non-power manageable devices (those without _PS0 or _PR0), ACPI
  doesn't help decide the low-power state.

[This confuses me too.  Even here pci_set_power_state() uses
pci_platform_power_transition(), i.e., ACPI, but I guess this only
uses _OFF/_ON and doesn't count as "power managed"?

Maybe that makes sense since _OFF/_ON are part of sec 7.2 ("Declaring
a Power Resource Object", which is separate from *7.3* ("Device Power
Management Objects") where _PR0, _PS0, _PRW, _SxD, _SxW, etc are.]

  However, extensions like the ACPI PNP0D80 System Power Management
  Controller device can provide constraints on the allowable low-power
  states.

  Add platform_get_constraint() so pci_target_state() can discover
  constraints from these extensions and avoid choosing a deeper
  low-power state than the platform allows.

[Again, this *seems* backwards to how that _DSM is documented.]

This covers the Intel PNP0D80 _DSM.  But
lpi_device_get_constraints_amd() implies that there's a similar but
different AMD version?  Is there a published spec for the AMD _DSM?

The non-x86 acpi_get_lps0_constraint() stub returns -ENODEV, which
doesn't seem quite right because map_acpi_to_pci() assumes it gets
ACPI_STATE_D0, etc.

I think it happens to work out fine because if it gets something
that's not ACPI_STATE_*, map_acpi_to_pci() returns PCI_POWER_ERROR,
but that's unholy knowledge of the ACPI_STATE_* values.
