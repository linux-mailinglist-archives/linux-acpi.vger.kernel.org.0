Actually, to start with, you can say that the ACPI power state
returned by acpi_device_get_power() may depend on the configuration of
ACPI power resources in the system which may change at any time after
acpi_device_get_power() has returned, unless the reference counters of
the ACPI power resources in question are set to prevent that from
happening.  Thus it is invalid to use acpi_device_get_power() in
acpi_pci_get_power_state() the way it is done now and the value of the
power.state field in the corresponding struct acpi_device object
(which reflects the ACPI power resources reference counting, among
other things) should be used instead.

Then you can describe the particular issue below as an example.

IMO that would explain the rationale better here.
