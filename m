Right, I would expect the same.

We could add something like this.  But both the e820 entry and the
host bridge window are already in the dmesg log, so it doesn't really
add new information, and I don't think there's anything *wrong* with
this situation (per the UEFI text above), so I don't think we need to
call attention to it.

I think what might add useful information would be to always log the
EFI "RUN" entries.  IIUC, currently the "efi: mem47: ..." lines are
only emitted when booting with "efi=debug"?

I think the "RUN" lines indicate regions that must be virtually mapped
so EFI runtime services can use them, and it seems like it might be
more generally useful to always mention them.
