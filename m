15us is based on the data sheet and if the kernel is ready to serve us
after 15us then let's do that.

I don't agree, and in particular putting 100 here because it's 1/10 of
the number I just made up doesn't sounds like a good reason. The
datasheet says 15us, so that is at least based on something real.


In https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/timers/timers-howto.txt
I find the following:

    With the introduction of a range, the scheduler is
    free to coalesce your wakeup with any other wakeup
    that may have happened for other reasons, or at the
    worst case, fire an interrupt for your upper bound.

    The larger a range you supply, the greater a chance
    that you will not trigger an interrupt; this should
    be balanced with what is an acceptable upper bound on
    delay / performance for your specific code path. Exact
    tolerances here are very situation specific, thus it
    is left to the caller to determine a reasonable range.

Which to me says that the wider range is perfectly reasonable. In
particular 15, 30 (which seems to be quite common) makes the available
range to the scheduler unnecessarily narrow.

And it's clear that whatever the upper bound it's going to be some
arbitrary number, but 1ms should ensure that there are other hrtimer
interrupts to piggy back on.

Bjorn
