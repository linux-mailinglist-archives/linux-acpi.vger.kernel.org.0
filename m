Changes since v4 [1]:
- Rework the object model to better account for downstream ports and
  enumerate decode capabilities.
- Include the definition of CFMWS
- Reference CFMWS in the changelogs and implementation
- Drop mention of pcie_portdriver for CXL switch enumeration. This will
  be handled by CXL path validation when an endpoint wants to contribute
  to a memory region.

The recently published CXL Fixed Memory Window Structure (CFMWS)
extension to the CXL Early Discovery Table (CEDT) provides a platform
firmware mechanism to enumerate CXL memory resources. The table data
indicates which CXL memory ranges were configured by platform BIOS, and
which address ranges are available to support hot plug and dynamic
provisioning of CXL memory regions.

CXL Port Topology:

The enumeration starts with the ACPI0017 driver registering a 'struct
cxl_port' object to establish the top of a port topology. It then
scans the ACPI bus looking for CXL Host Bridges (ACPI0016 instances). A
cxl_port represents one or more decoder resources between a 'uport'
(upstream port) and one or more 'dport' (downstream port) instances.
System software must not assume that 'struct cxl_port' device names will
be static from one boot to the next. It will generally be the case that
the root cxl_port starts at id '0' and the host bridges are enumerated
in the same order starting at id '1', but that is not guaranteed.

A 'uport' is a device that implements a decode. It can either be a
platform firmware device like ACPI0017 where the decode is described by
an ACPI data-structure, or a PCIe switch where the upstream port of the
switch implements a CXL DVSEC pointing to component registers with the
HDM decoder capability (see CXL 2.0 section 8.2.5.12 CXL HDM Decoder
Capability Structure).

Once a uport and its corresponding dport instances are collected into a
cxl_port the actual decode resources are then modeled as cxl_decode
objects that are children of their parent cxl_port. The 'decode' object
has a 1:1 relationship with ether CFMWS entries at the root level, or
hardware HDM decoder register instances in a PCIe device's CXL component
register space at any level of a CXL switch hierarchy. In addition to
the interleave geometry and address range a decode object conveys the
target list (targeted dports) in interleave order. The dport id in a
target list is either its ACPI _UID for Host Bridge targets, or the
"port number" field from the link capabilities register in the PCIe
"Express" capability [2].

Here is a tree(1) topology of QEMU emulating a single-ported
host-bridge:

    /sys/bus/cxl/devices/root0
    ├── devtype
    ├── dport0 -> ../LNXSYSTM:00/LNXSYBUS:00/ACPI0016:00
    ├── port1
    │   ├── decoder1.0
    │   │   ├── devtype
    │   │   ├── end
    │   │   ├── locked
    │   │   ├── start
    │   │   ├── subsystem -> ../../../../bus/cxl
    │   │   ├── target_list
    │   │   ├── target_type
    │   │   └── uevent
    │   ├── devtype

    │   ├── uevent
    │   └── uport -> ../../LNXSYSTM:00/LNXSYBUS:00/ACPI0016:00
    ├── subsystem -> ../../bus/cxl
    ├── uevent
    └── uport -> ../platform/ACPI0017:00


* The root port is singleton only by convention. A given uport device
  like ACPI0017 could create a root level port per CFMWS entry. This
  patch set chooses to implement 1 port at the root level and list all
  CFMWS decode entries under that port regardless of which dport host
  bridges are targeted.

[2]: CXL 2.0 8.2.5.12.8 CXL HDM Decoder 0 Target List Low Register
     (Offset 24h) ...The Target Port Identifier for a given Downstream Port
     is reported via Port Number field in Link Capabilities Register. (See
     PCI Express Base Specification).
