No, not exactly.  There's some interrupt information in the ACPI MADT,
but that's just for very specific sources (Interrupt Source Override
Structures)

Then on AML devices can have resource descriptors that contain
information about how interrupts are setup.  However Xen is not able
to read any of this information on AML.

Legacy PCI interrupts are (always?) level triggered and low polarity,
because it's assumed that an interrupt source can be shared between
multiple devices.

I'm however not able to find any reference to this in the PCI spec,
hence I'm reluctant to take this for granted in Xen, and default all
GSIs >= 16 to such mode.

OTOH legacy PCI interrupts are not that used anymore, as almost all
devices will support MSI(-X) (because PCIe mandates it) and OSes
should prefer the latter.  SR-IOV VF don't even support legacy PCI
interrupts anymore.

One suitable compromise would be to default unconfigured GSIs >= 16 to
level-triggered and low-polarity, as I would expect that to work in
almost all cases.  We can always introduce the usage of
PHYSDEVOP_setup_gsi later if required.

Maybe Jan has more input here, would you agree to defaulting non-ISA
GSIs to level-triggered, low-polarity in the absence of a specific
setup provided by dom0?

Thanks, Roger.
