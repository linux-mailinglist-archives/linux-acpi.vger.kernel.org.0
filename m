OK, thanks.  So it sounds like there is some existing kernel code that
special-cases GICv2 interrupts to make them level/high, and that code
would not have been necessary if _PRS/_SRS had been optional from the
beginning.

I don't think we could ever *remove* that code because there's
firmware in the field that relies on it, and that firmware will never
be updated.

But that said, I'm not opposed to making _PRS/_SRS optional if that
makes legal and reasonable _PRT descriptions work, and if all the
considerations Rafael mentioned are taken care of.
