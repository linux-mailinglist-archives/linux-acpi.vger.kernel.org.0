I haven't seen this type of problem in years, but as I recall, it was always
low-end consumer crap that couldn't deal with changing BARs; you're stuck with
whatever was set after it was initially powered on. The PCI topology will
reflect the expected renumbering, but whatever is happening on the other side
of the PCI function seems to be unaware of the change.
