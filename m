No version. I had been thinking it gets confusing with a new IOCTL, but you're
correct that it should be trivial to determine ENOTTY from Send is different
than ENOTTY from another IOCTL.

I'll change it.

It does need to switch to vmemdup_user(), I didn't mean to disagree there.

For posterity btw, I'll point out CXL 2.0 max is 2M for payload.

I think taint is something that could change between driver versions, and even
based on the underlying device. However, since Raw command will always taint, we
can save that for another day and I will drop it from this patch.

As an example, perhaps we know device X's active firmware update is flaky - we
can make that a tainted command just for that device.
