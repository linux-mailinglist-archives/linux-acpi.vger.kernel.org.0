Subject: [PATCH v3 16/17] PCI: Add CRS handling to pci_dev_wait()

From: Stanislav Spassov <stanspas@amazon.de>

The PCI Express specification dictates minimal amounts of time that the
host needs to wait after triggering different kinds of resets before it
is allowed to attempt accessing the device. After this waiting period,
devices are required to be responsive to Configuration Space reads.
However, if a device needs more time to actually complete the reset
operation internally, it may respond to the read with a Completion
Request Retry Status (CRS), and keep doing so on subsequent reads
for as long as necessary. If the device is broken, it may even keep
responding with CRS indefinitely.

The specification also mandates that any Root Port that supports CRS
and has CRS Software Visibility (CRS SV) enabled will synthesize the
special value 0x0001 for the Vendor ID and set any other bits to 1
upon receiving a CRS Completion for a Configuration Read Request that
includes both bytes of the Vendor ID (offset 0).

IF CRS is supported by Root Port but CRS SV is not enabled, the request
is retried autonomously by the Root Port. Platform-specific configuration
registers may exist to limit the number of or time taken by such retries.

If CRS is not supported, or a different register (not Vendor ID) is
polled, or the device is responding with CA/UR Completions (rather than
CRS), the behavior is platform-dependent, but generally the Root Port
synthesizes ~0 to complete the software read.

Previously, pci_dev_wait() avoided taking advantage of CRS. However,
on platforms where no limit/timeout can be configured as explained
above, a device responding with CRS for too long (e.g. because it is
stuck and cannot complete its reset) may trigger more severe error
conditions (e.g. TOR timeout, 3-strike CPU CATERR), because the Root
Port never reports back to the lower-level component requesting the
transaction.

This patch introduces special handling when CRS is available, and
otherwise falls back to the previous behavior of polling COMMAND.
