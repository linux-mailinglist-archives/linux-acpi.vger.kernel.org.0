Thank you, that is what I have been trying to get across here, obviously
I didn't do a good job.  :)

Thanks for the summary.

Agreed.

I really do not want yet-another-kernel-command-line-option if we can
help it at all.  Sane defaults are the best thing to do here.  Userspace
comes up really early, put your policy in there, not in blobs passed
from your bootloader.
