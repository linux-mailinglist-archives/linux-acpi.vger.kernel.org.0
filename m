The point I'm trying to make here is to explain why this is problem now
and not with the previous discrete controllers. With the previous there
was only a single ACPI power resource for the root port and the
Thunderbolt host router was connected to that root port. PCIe hierarchy
was extended through downstream ports (not root ports) of that
controller (which includes PCIe switch).

Now the thing is part of the SoC so power management is different and
causes problems in Linux.

Thanks, I'll fix it.
