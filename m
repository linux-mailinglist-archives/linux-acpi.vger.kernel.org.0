Just for the record, I think it's even worse than just reserving them
in the wrong order.  IIRC, we don't reserve ACPI/PNP resources *at
all* except for PNP0C01 and PNP0C02 (drivers/pnp/system.c) and
whatever individual drivers reserve.  This is like pretending that
devices don't respond to their address space until a driver claims
them.  But I'm not suggesting opening this can of worms for *this*
problem.

Not sure I understand; are you saying that we wouldn't have the EC/GPE
issue, but we'd be unable to use a device below 3a:00.0 that happened
to have an I/O BAR?  That doesn't sound optimal because there is I/O
space available that could be routed to 3a:00.0
