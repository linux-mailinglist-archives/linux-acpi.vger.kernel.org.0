I might be misunderstanding your examples, as they are somewhat vague
and hypothetical.

Drawing from my experience working on Tianocore, allow me to give a
few examples myself:
- ArmVirtQemu (ARM port of OVMF) receives information about system RAM
via memory nodes in the device tree, using device_type=memory, from
QEMU, which fulfills the role of platform init in this case.
ArmVirtQemu currently doesn't consume the /reserved-memory node as
QEMU does not populate it, but that would be the appropriate place to
document RAM regions that Tianocore must treat as reserved;
- DeveloperBox [0] (based on Socionext SynQuacer) receives a platform
specific struct with memory regions and reservations in a patch of
SRAM that the early Tianocore code uses for stack and heap. Note that
system RAM is not available yet at this point (as it is being
discovered via this mechanism) and SRAM is quite tight, so DT is not
an option here;
- The Tianocore port for Raspberry Pi 4 [1] receives RAM information
from the VideoCore firmware by calling the mailbox interface. This
covers both available memory and reserved memory (for the GPU). The
statically allocated TF-A code and data regions that reside in
non-secure DRAM on this platform are reserved implicitly due to the
fact that they are part of the same firmware image, which knows not to
step on itself.

In none of these cases, I see a need for the binding that you propose.
Platfom Init -> Payload handover is highly platform specific, so
adding another generic DT binding for an as yet unidentified use case
seems seems premature at the very least.

The /memory node is documented in the DT specification. The
/reserved-memory node is documented here:

No, I haven't looked at those yet. Maybe the uboot community is
different, but in the Linux community, we tend to finish discussing vN
of a series before sendindg out vN+1. This prevents the kind of
parallel track discussions that seem to be taking place here. Also, it
is highly appreciated when an author takes all feedback into account
(or at least acknowledges it) in a vN+1 submission, which is difficult
to do before the discussion around vN has concluded.

The problem is that you are not using /reserved-memory to describe a
memory reservation but something new that all DT consumers need to be
taught about, or they might step on memory that turns out to be
reserved. The DT ecosystem is large and heterogeneous, and any tool or
boot stage in existence is at the risk of stepping on this memory
inadvertently, whereas /reserved-memory already provides the means to
reserve it and document its nature.

I have already indicated how this should be resolved in my opinion,
which is by using the /reserved-memory node to describe memory
reservations, and not this binding.
