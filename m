A few things:
1. With this default CONFIG_ACPI_CPPC_CPUFREQ_FIE=y we've introduced
a performance regression on older HW servers, which is not good IMO.
It looks like it wasn't a good idea. The FIE which is used in a tick
and going through mailbox and FW sounds like a bad design.
You need to have a really fast HW mailbox, FW and uC running it,
to be able to provide a decent performance.
2. Keeping a code which is not used in a server because at runtime we
discover this PCC overhead issue doesn't make sense.
3. System integrator or distro engineers should be able to experiment
with different kernel config options on the platform and disable/
enable this option on particular server. I am afraid that we cannot
figure out and assume performance at runtime in this code and say
it would be good or not to use it. Only stress-tests would tell this.
