This particular check doesn't pertain to a defect, but indeed
follows from the spec:

If hotplug control wasn't granted to the OS, the OS shall not put
the hotplug port in D3 behind firmware's back because the power state
affects accessibility of devices downstream of the hotplug port.

Put another way, the firmware expects to have control of hotplug
and hotplug may break if the OS fiddles with the power state of the
hotplug port.

Here's a bugzilla where this caused issues:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53811

On the other hand Thunderbolt hotplug ports are required to runtime
suspend to D3 in order to save power.  On Macs they're always handled
natively by the OS.  Hence the code comment.

A somewhat longer explanation I gave in 2016:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20160617213209.GA1927@wunner.de/

Perhaps the code comment preceding that check can be rephrased to
convey its meaning more clearly...

Thanks,

Lukas
