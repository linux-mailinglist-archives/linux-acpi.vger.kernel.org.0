Well, it is an improvement, but it is not sufficient.

-> the "resume from S3 or hibernation" case needs special handling, because
in that case the device power state need not reflect the information the ACPI
subsystem has.  That only matters if adev->power.state is ACPI_STATE_D0 and
the device is actually *not* in D0, because in that case acpi_device_set_power()
will not work.  So that case is not covered currently (it should be rare in practice,
though, if it happens at all), so something like the patch below (untested) may
be needed in addition to the Mika's patch.

Still, there is also the "power state not matching" case in pci_pm_complete() that's
need to be covered and the non-PCI ACPI PM has a similar issue in theory, so I
need to think about this a bit more.
