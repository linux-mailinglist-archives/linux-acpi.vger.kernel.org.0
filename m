The problem is that we don't want to add device IDs every time a new
chip comes out.  Adding one or two device IDs for silicon that's
already released is not a problem as long as you have a strategy for
*future* devices so they don't require a quirk.

_DSM indeed requires a vendor-specific UUID, precisely *because*
vendors are free to define their own functionality without requiring
changes to the ACPI spec.  From the spec (ACPI v6.3, sec 9.1.1):

  New UUIDs may also be created by OEMs and IHVs for custom devices
  and other interface or device governing bodies (e.g. the PCI SIG),
  as long as the UUID is different from other published UUIDs.
