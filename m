Where is this "noacpi" parameter?  Is this an intel_idel param?  I see
libata.noacpi and pci=noacpi but nothing like this for intel_idle.

Also, the wording is a little confusing.  What does it mean "if that parameter is equal
to 1"?  It's basically a word that is entered without a value AFAICT.

This contains lots of good info, but I don't see all of it as admin-guide/ material.
Lots of it is driver-development info, not admin info.  IMHO.
