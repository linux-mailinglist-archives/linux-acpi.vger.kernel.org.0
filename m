Can you be specific in the subject and commit log about whether "D3"
refers to "D3hot", "D3cold", or both?  It's probably obvious to PM
folks, but it's always a stumbling block for me.

I assume "can't handle USB devices waking" does not refer to a problem
with the USB adapter and whatever mechanism it uses to send a wakeup
event to request that power be turned on, but rather it means that the
wakeup event doesn't get propagated through the Root Port?

Is this actually specific to USB devices?  Or could a NIC below the
Root Port suffer the same problem when a wake-on-lan packet causes it
to send a wakeup event?  It seems like we've had this conversation
before; sorry to ask the same questions again.

If it's not specific to USB, I would say something like "when the Root
Port is in D3cold, wakeup events from devices below it are lost" (or
whatever the actual problem is).

Is the AMD PMC driver doing something magic that can't be done via
other power management paths?  That's what "only when the AMD PMC
driver is utilized" suggests.  But if the problem occurs when the Root
Port is put into D3cold via *any* means, just say that.

And if you can say a specific PCI power state instead of "hardware
sleep state", that would be good, too.

I hate to add more uses of pci_get_device() because it doesn't account
for hot-added devices.  Maybe there's no need to support hot-add of
AMD Root Ports, but that's not obvious to readers here.

One mechanism to avoid pci_get_device() is to use quirks, although it
might be hard to deal with PCI/ACPI ordering issues.

If we're trying to determine a property of the device, why does the
current power state make a difference?

It looks like this loop runs every time we suspend (from
amd_pmc_suspend_handler()), even though this is something we should
know at boot-time, so we only need it once.

D3hot?  D3cold?  Both?  "lack of constraint"?
