I just got a report back from the Fedora test 5.16.12 kernel
with this series added on the X1C2 which had the suspend/resume
regression with my DMI_BIOS_DATE based approach. Everything still
works well there and it shows the new log messages from 2/3 in action:

[    0.326504] acpi PNP0A08:00: clipped [mem 0xdfa00000-0xfebfffff window] to [mem 0xdfa10000-0xfebfffff window] for e820 entry [mem 0xdceff000-0xdfa0ffff]
[    0.326515] acpi PNP0A08:00: clipped [mem 0xdfa10000-0xfebfffff window] to [mem 0xdfa10000-0xf7ffffff window] for e820 entry [mem 0xf8000000-0xfbffffff]
