Mh, but then the fwnode_for_each_child_node() is very misleading, esp.
with the presence of fwnode_for_each_available_child_node().

I was trying to fix the lan966x driver [1] which doesn't work if there
are disabled nodes in between. My steps would have been:
  (1) change fwnode_for_each_available_child_node() to
      fwnode_for_each_child_node(), maybe with a fixes tag, as it's
      easy to backport
  (2) introduce new compatibles and deduce the number of ports
      according to the compatible string and not by counting
      the child nodes.
  (3) keep the old behavior for the legacy compatible and mark it
      as deprecated in the binding
  (4) move the device tree over to the new compatible string
