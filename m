You mean also for the lan9662? I'm pretty sure that doesn't
work. Have a look where num_phys_ports is used. One random
example:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/net/ethernet/microchip/lan966x/lan966x_main.c#L874

So if your switch only has 4 ports, then I'd guess you'll
access a non-existing register.
