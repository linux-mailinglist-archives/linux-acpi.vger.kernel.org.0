It is not possible to have a defined for the MAX number of ports that
supported by lan966x. Which is 8. And assigned that define to
num_phys_ports instead of counting the entries in DT?
I have seen that sparx5 is doing something similar. [1]

Also unfortunately, I am not aware of any register that says if it is
lan9662 or lan9668.

Also lan9662 can have up to 4 ports.
