Fair enough, though the interface should be root only, so a vendor shooting
themselves in the foot this way would be no different to using pcitools
to access the device directly (we are just providing safety from concurrency
point of view).

Anyway, I can see two options for how to do this.

1) Per protocol interface. Would not be generic, as these work in entirely
   different ways (some are simple read back of tables, some require complex
   cycles of operations in the right order with data flowing in both directions)
2) White list those protocols we are going to let through a generic interface
   Not including CXL compliance for instance as that has nasty side effects!

If we want to enable userspace DOE access, I prefer option 2.

Note that I wasn't that keen on a userspace interface in the first place as
in my view these should all be handled in kernel.
Ultimately we should have case 1 if userspace access make sense.
However, if we do this we shouldn't pretend we are providing userspace
access to the DOE at all.  We are providing interfaces to things that just
happen to be implemented using DOE under the hood.

I have a prototype of a trivial ioctl based interface. I'll send it out
as an RFC later this week.  Might add a white list, depending on where
this discussion goes.
