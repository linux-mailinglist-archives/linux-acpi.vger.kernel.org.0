Sigh. We can't apply this patch since it would trigger regressions on
other platforms (IIUC the root complex registers would end up in the
host bridge memory windows).

I am not keen on reverting commit 8fd4391ee717 because it does the
right thing.

I think this requires a quirk and immediate reporting to Microsoft.

Bjorn, what are your thoughts on this ?

Thanks,
Lorenzo
