It sounds like you've seen this sort of problem before, so we
shouldn't assume that it's safe to reassign BARs.

I think Windows supports rebalancing, but it does look like drivers
have the ability to veto it:

  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/stopping-a-device-to-rebalance-resources
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/the-pnp-manager-redistributes-system-resources

So I suppose if/when we support rebalancing, it'll have to be an
opt-in thing for each driver.
