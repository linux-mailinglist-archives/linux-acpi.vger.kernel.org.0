That seems backwards to me, but we have a fair bit of ACPI and PCI
stuff that's backwards.

Just from a "beautiful design" perspective, it seems suboptimal for
the ACPI device tree to have to include Device objects for all
possible hot-added devices.

I would expect hot-add to be handled via a Bus Check to the *parent*
of a new device, so the device tree would only need to describe
hardware that's present at boot.  That would mean pci_root.c would
have some .notify() handler, but I don't see anything there.

I don't know if platforms really implement Root Port hot-add (maybe
qemu?), but if they do, I could believe they might do it via Notify to
an ACPI Device for a non-present hardware device.  I wouldn't know
whether that's the intent of the spec, or just a reaction to something
that happened to work with existing OSes.

Yep, that's the audience :)  I want to make it as easy as reasonably
possible for non-qemu experts to repro things.

Yeah, it's a complicated mess.  That's why I didn't think this would
be a viable fix in the short term.
