Interesting! Does it mean that PCIe Root Complex / Host Bridge (which I
guess contains also logic for Root Port) does not signal transaction
failure for config requests? Or it is just your opinion? Because I'm
dealing with similar issues and I'm trying to find a way how to detect
if some PCIe IP signal transaction error via AXI SLVERR response OR it
just does not send any response back. So if you know some way how to
check which one it is, I would like to know it too.

Yes, SError is arm64 specific. It is asynchronous CPU interrupt and
syndrome code then contains what happened.

Could you describe (ideally in commit message) which SError is
triggered? Normally if kernel receive SError interrupt it also puts into
dmesg or oops message also syndrome code which describe what kind of
error / event occurred. It could help also to other understand what is
happening there.
