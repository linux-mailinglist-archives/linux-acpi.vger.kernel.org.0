No, all we can say is that this OS rev 4 code works on the platforms
we've tested.  Other platforms might have their own defects.

My point is that this OS code was written to the rev 4 spec and has
been tested, and we shouldn't change the code or the revision it uses
unless we're fixing something.

This is an unnecessary change, since the OS tested its rev 4 code and
now we're saying the OS should use rev 5 instead, which the OS did not
test.  The reason rev 5 exists at all is probably that some completely
unrelated new function was added, and somebody decided it should be
rev 5.

I guess function 0 *could* have been defined to answer "yes/no" about
whether a single (function, revision) is implemented.  Then we
probably wouldn't be having this conversation.

But we do get an entire bitmask of implemented functions back from
function 0, which allows the possibility of using the same revision
for all the functions.  I suppose we could have a boot-time function
that calls function 0 with rev 0, 1, 2, ..., until it gets an empty
bitmask, and saves the highest rev with a non-empty mask.

In PCI we don't do that; instead, we call acpi_check_dsm() before
every acpi_evaluate_dsm().  The main reason is that I don't think it's
safe to change the function X rev just because function Y was added
later with a higher revision.

Yes.  But the requirement that rev 5 must support all functions ever
previously documented for the UUID still makes no sense to me.  I
don't think there's any requirement that a platform implement ALL of
the documented PCI functions.

Maybe the intent is that this only applies to a given platform, i.e.,
that new firmware for that platform must continue to support all
functions and revisions that were ever supported on that platform?
That seems obvious to me and hardly worth mentioning.

That's exactly what I'm saying, although I think problems are more
likely across different platforms.  There's the requirement in the
spec, but that's just words on a page.  There's no way to enforce or
validate it.

I don't *expect* rev 5 to be different.  But as a user of it, why
would I change working, tested code that is not broken?

The PCI DPC function 0xc is an example where rev 5 (per ECN) and rev 6
(per r3.3) are not compatible.

If the OS implemented rev 5, then learns via function 0 that function
0xc is also supported at rev 6, and starts using the same OS code with
rev 6, the OS is broken.
