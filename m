Can you explain this reasoning a little more?  I claim Linux does not
natively comprehend reserving the MMCFG region, but it sounds like you
don't agree?  I think "native" comprehension would mean Linux would
not need the MCFG table.

Is there some reason this can't be made public (it's obviously fine to
redact proprietary details)?  It's really hard to make this code work
for all the cases even when we know all the details, and practically
impossible if we don't.

We definitely need to change Linux so it works correctly with firmware
in the field, whether that means fixing a Linux defect or working
around a firmware defect.

Can you boot with 'efi=debug dyndbg="file arch/x86/pci +p"' and share
the complete dmesg log (redacted if necessary) somewhere?  It's
important to know more about why and how this doesn't work.  I added
more debug logging, but possibly it's still not enough.

The EfiMemoryMappedIO entry is not a *reservation* (this was a poor
choice of words in the logging, and my series changes it).  This entry
only means the firmware requests that the OS map this region to a
virtual address so it can be used by EFI runtime services (UEFI v2.9,
sec 7.2).

Is there some spec language that says MCFG reserves space?  I'm not
aware of anything about ACPI static tables reserving MMIO space.
Here's my reasoning around static tables vs _CRS for reservations:
