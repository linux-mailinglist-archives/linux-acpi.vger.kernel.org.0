That's until the proper EC object is discovered, though.

This works.

I would rename address_space_handler_handle to something like
address_space_handler_holder.

So we need this in ACPICA, because it doesn't make sense to drop and
re-acquire the namespace mutex around _REG evaluation in the non-EC
case.

But as stated before I would prefer to introduce an
acpi_install_address_space_handler_internal() taking an additional
BOOL run__reg argument  and I would define
acpi_install_address_space_handler() and the new
acpi_install_address_space_handler_no__reg() as wrappers around it.

> 2. acpi_run_address_space_handler__reg()

So this would just be a wrapper around acpi_ev_execute_reg_methods()
that would acquire the namespace mutex around it, right?  [I think
that it should also acquire acpi_gbl_namespace_rw_lock along the lines
of acpi_walk_namespace(), though.]

I would call it acpi_execute_reg_methods() then.
