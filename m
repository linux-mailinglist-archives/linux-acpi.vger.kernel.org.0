I submitted the dmesg logs in bugzilla:

I also built from current master (still 26aff849438c) to verify and it's
still broken for me.

For me it's (always with build from current master):

-smp 1 -> it worked 5 times out of 5
-smp 2 -> it worked 3 times out of 5
-smp 4 -> it worked 0 times out of 5
-smp 8 -> it worked 0 times out of 5
