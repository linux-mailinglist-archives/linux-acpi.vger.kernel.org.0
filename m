Yes.

Given that no one deals or can easily deal with these failures we
should probably take care of that.  IMHO we could just allocate a
single static range and point all the devices to it, what would
you think of that?

Well, I need to beat the dead horse to avoid having to export the
function, which will really just bread new users.  So at the minimum
we'd need to move the setup to platform code that is always built in.
