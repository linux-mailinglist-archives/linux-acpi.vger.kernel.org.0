how about following commit message (incorporating all feed back in this thread):

-- cut --
Commit [1] switched acpiphp hotplug to use
   pci_assign_unassigned_bridge_resources()
which depends on bridge being available, however in case
when acpiphp is enabled [2], enable_slot() can be called without
bridge associated.
  1. legitimate case of hotplug on root bus
      (widely used in virt world)
  2. a (misbehaving) firmware, that sends 'Bus check' events
     to non existing root ports (Dell Inspiron 7352/0W6WV0),
     which endup at acpiphp:enable_slot(..., bridge = 0)
     where bus has not bridge assigned to it.
     acpihp doesn't know that it's a bridge, and bus specific
     'PCI subsystem' can't argument ACPI context with bridge
     information since the PCI device to get this data from
     is/was not available.

Issue is easy to reproduce with QEMU's 'pc' machine, which supports
PCI hotplug on hostbridge slots. To reproduce boot kernel at
commit [1] in VM started with following CLI (assuming guest root fs
is installed on sda1 partition):

   # qemu-system-x86_64 -M pc -m 1G -enable-kvm -cpu host \
         -monitor stdio -serial file:serial.log           \
         -kernel arch/x86/boot/bzImage                    \
         -append "root=/dev/sda1 console=ttyS0"           \
         guest_disk.img

once guest OS is fully booted at qemu prompt:

(qemu) device_add e1000

(check serial.log) it will cause NULL pointer dereference at:

    void pci_assign_unassigned_bridge_resources(struct pci_dev *bridge)
    {
        struct pci_bus *parent = bridge->subordinate;

The issue was discovered on Dell Inspiron 7352/0W6WV0 laptop with
following sequence:
   1. suspend to RAM
   2. wake up with the same backtrace being observed:
   3. 2nd suspend to RAM attempt makes laptop freeze

Fix it by using __pci_bus_assign_resources() instead of
pci_assign_unassigned_bridge_resources() as we used to do
but only in case when bus doesn't have a bridge associated
(to cover for the case of ACPI event on hostbridge or
non existing root port).

That let us keep hotplug on root bus working like it used to be
and at the same time keeps resource reassignment usable on
root ports (and other 1st level bridges) that was fixed by [1].

I'll try to trace call path and see where it leads
(based on a guess in updated commit message: OS/nor ACPI
has info if it's bridge when the device didn't exists
during boot).

(though, I don't think it should hold this patch.
while it would be good to understand where bridge
gets added in acpi context, it's not directly relevant
to the fixing hotplug on hostbridge and buscheck events 
on non-existing root-ports)
