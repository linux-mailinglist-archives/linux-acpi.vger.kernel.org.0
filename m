Ugh.  Yes, I'm sure it's not an isolated problem.

Thanks.  I don't know anything about FWTS, but I'm a little skeptical
that it actually catches this issue.  It *looks* like FWTS builds its
idea of the memory map from a dmesg log or /sys/firmware/memmap, which
I think both come from the E820 map, which is x86-specific, of course.

I don't see anything that builds a memory map based on _CRS methods,
which I think is what we really want since the spec says:

  The resources can optionally be returned in Int15 E820h or
  EFIGetMemoryMap as reserved memory but must always be reported
  through ACPI as a motherboard resource.

(PCI Firmware spec r3.3, sec 4.1.2)

We definitely need to work around this in Linux, and your patch might
well be the right thing.

I'm a *little* hesitant because all the code in mmconfig-shared.c that
attempts to validate MCFG entries suggests that relying on them
uncritically was a problem in some cases, so I want to try to convince
myself that we really won't break something.
