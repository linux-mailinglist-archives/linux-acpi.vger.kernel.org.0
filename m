Yah, that is a problem. The ID's provided by the ACPI cache ID field are 
as officially meaningless as the ones we can generate from the existing 
fw_token mechanism. Given that, they don't really add anything beyond 
what we can achieve simply by encoding the level somewhere in the 
fw_token currently in use if we want something that is globally unique 
rather than just unique for a given cache level+I/D. Their one advantage 
though is that they can be more human readable at the cost of 2-3X the 
size of the table, with the additional problem of having to worry about 
them being populated in all the cache structures in the table. Its 
almost easier to revisit some of the earlier discussion and generate a 
uniq id, and then renumber them at the end.


If you want to encode some kind of routing ID in them, then that will 
have to be standardized, and I would guess it might be easier to add the 
routing ID's to the structure than retroactively add meaning to the ID 
field if anyone is actually using it. Or just create yet another lookup 
table to translate the id to something meaningful.
