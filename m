Sorry, but this is an empty statement without any substance.

Because it wouldn't work.

No, it is not the only one.  Every driver that needs to handle trip
point update notifications from the platform firmware will have this
problem.

Then it would need to walk the trips[] table in the thermal zone, if I
understand the suggestion correctly, which goes kind of against your
previous changes.

But the driver needs to get from priv to trips[i], not the other way around.

They could if the trips did not get reordered.  Otherwise they would
need to walk trips[] every time and have a way to match each trip
against its private counterpart.

I guess they could use the address of the private part as a tag in
this, but is walking trips[] by drivers something that you really
want?

Well, this is a matter of opinion to me.  Clearly, I disagree with it.

Anyway, I want to be productive, so here's the thing: either something
like this is done, or drivers need to be allowed to walk the trips
table.

Which one is better?
