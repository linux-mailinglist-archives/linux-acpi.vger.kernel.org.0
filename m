So I just got the first report back from the Fedora test 5.16.12 kernel
with this series added. Good news on the ideapad this wotks fine to
fix the touchpad issue (as expected).

What is interesting is that the above dev_info message which I added
triggers *twice*:

[    0.327837] acpi PNP0A08:00: resource [mem 0x000a0000-0x000bffff window] fully covered by e820 entry [mem 0x0009f000-0x000fffff]
[    0.327843] acpi PNP0A08:00: resource [mem 0x65400000-0xbfffffff window] fully covered by e820 entry [mem 0x4bc50000-0xcfffffff]

Notice that it also stops from the mem-window for ISA io getting fully
clipped, which I did not realize also was a potential issue.

I hope this also shows that having the dev_info here is good,
at least IMHO this confirms that having the dev_info for this
is a good thing.

I'm still waiting for testing results on the X1C2 which had the
suspend/resume regressions with my bios-date based approach.

Regards,

Hans
