Hi Rafael,

thanks for taking the time to go through the series.

I'm surprised it is less understandable. The ACPI trip points structure 
have nested and duplicated descriptions. The resulting code goes through 
these structures depending on the type.

In order to convert the code to deal with the same structure, the first 
patches are moving the structures into a single one, so can more easily 
replace one by another.

Before doing a full conversion to the trip point changes, they co-exist.

Is it the conversion itself or how the changes are done?

Do you mean the adding a 'private' field in the trip point structure:

struct thermal_trip {
         int temperature;
         int hysteresis;
         enum thermal_trip_type type;
	void *data;
};

?

Yes, I think we should introduce a new function:

thermal_zone_device_trips_update(struct thermal_zone_device *tz,
	struct thermal_trip *trips, int nr_trips);

I recently sent a patch when passing the thermal zone parameters where 
the structure is kmemdup'ed and stored in the thermal zone device 
structure [1].

[1] 
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230307133735.90772-11-daniel.lezcano@linaro.org/

That allows to initialize the thermal zone device and let the core code 
thermal framework to do stuff with it.

The caller does not have to keep the thermal zone device parameter 
structure, it can create it on the stack and the forget it.

IMO, we should do the same for the thermal trip array. So the thermal 
framework kmemdups it, reorders it if needed. The thermal trip array is 
then just an initialization array and once it is passed to 
thermal_zone_device_register_with_trips(), the driver should not use it 
anymore but use the thermal framework API.

Having the private data in the thermal trip structure will allow the 
ACPI to store the trip id, so the trip array can be reordered.

IMO, the function thermal_zone_device_trips_update() can take care of:
  - delete the sysfs entries
  - reorder the trip points,
  - create the sysfs entries
  - notify THERMAL_ZONE_TRIP_CHANGED
  - update the thermal zone

Probably we can move part of the code from 
thermal_zone_device_register() into this function

The userspace should be aware of the THERMAL_ZONE_TRIP_CHANGED event.

However, I'm not sure there is an trip update leading to a change of the 
number of trip points as well as changing the order.
