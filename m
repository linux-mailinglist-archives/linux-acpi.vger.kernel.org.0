I agree, but it's better to update the wording of the spec.

The point I'm making is that I'm not sure all the memory access and
stall properties are the same for the parent and the device itself.

If the all the properties for parent and device itself are the same,
I have no strong opinion for this patch, but it's better to update
the wording of the spec as well.
