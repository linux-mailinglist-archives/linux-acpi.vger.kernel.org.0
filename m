As this is an initial driver, there's obviously no functional/regression testing
value in separating the patches.

This was the way we brought up the driver and how we verified functionality
incrementally. I see value in both capturing that in the history, as well as
making review a bit easier (which apparently failed for you).

I agree, I'll change this.

 We've (Intel) already started working on the libnvdimm integration which does
 change this around a bit. In order to go with what's best tested though, I've
 chosen to use this as is for merge. Many different people not just in Intel
 have tested these codepaths. The resulting code moves the check on register
 type out of this function entirely.

 If you'd like me to make it a switch, I can, but it's going to be extracted
 later anyway.
