Subject: [PATCH] PCI: ACPI: Fix up ACPI companion lookup for device 0 on the root bus

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

In some cases acpi_pci_find_companion() returns an incorrect device
object as the ACPI companion for device 0 on the root bus (bus 0).

On the affected systems that device is the PCI interface to the
host bridge and the "ACPI companion" returned for it corresponds
to a non-PCI device located in the SoC (e.g. a sensor on an I2C
bus).  As a result of this, the ACPI device object "attached"
to PCI device 00:00.0 cannot be used for enumerating the device
that is really represented by it which (of course) is problematic.

Address that issue by preventing acpi_pci_find_companion() from
returning a device object with a valid _HID (which by the spec
should not be present uder ACPI device objects corresponding to
PCI devices) for PCI device 00:00.0.
