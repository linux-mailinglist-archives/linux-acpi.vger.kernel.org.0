Reportedly, if there are no ACPI power management objects associated
with a Root Port, Windows will always leave it in D0.

In that case, acpi_pci_bridge_d3() will return false unless the
HotPlugSupportInD3 property is present AFAICS, so the ACPI code will
not allow the port to be put into D3hot.

Consequently, platform_pci_bridge_d3() will return false and the only
thing that may allow the port to go into D0 is the dmi_get_bios_year()
check at the end of pci_bridge_d3_possible().

However, that was added, because there are Intel platforms on which
Root Ports need to be programmed into D3hot on suspend (which allows
the whole platform to reduce power significantly) and there are no
ACPI device power management objects associated with them (Mika should
know the gory details related to this).  It looks like under Windows
the additional power reduction would not be possible on those systems,
but that would be a problem, wouldn't it?

So it looks like there are some systems on which programming Root
Ports into D3hot is needed to achieve additional power reduction of
the platform and there are systems on which programming Root Ports
into D3hot breaks things and there are no ACPI power management
objects associated with these Root Ports in both cases.

The only way to make progress that I can think about right now is to
limit the dmi_get_bios_year() check at the end of
pci_bridge_d3_possible() to Intel platforms.
