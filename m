OK, got it. no need to check the bus,Â  then no need to add the else.

Yes, if remove "WACFXXX" from acpi_pnp_device_ids[], could fix this 
issue. I planned to do so, but I found the pnp_driver in the 
drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_pnp.c still handle this ID, maybe it could 
introduce regression on old machines if removing it.

Thanks.
