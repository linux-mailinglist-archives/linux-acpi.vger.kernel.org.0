From my limited understanding, IORT and VIOT is to solve device topology
enumeration only? I am not sure how it can be expanded to cover
information beyond device topology. e.g. DMAR has NUMA information and
root port ATS, I guess they are not used today in the guest but might
be additions in the future.
