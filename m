Hi Ira, thanks for taking a look.

So the question here is whether we can ever safely work with a
userspace that is accessing the DOE.  I think the answer is no we can't.

We'd have no way of knowing that userspace left the DOE in a clean state
without resetting every time we want to use it (which can take 1 second)
or doing significant sanity checking (can we tell if something is
in flight?).  Note that if userspace and kernel were talking different
protocols nothing sensible could be done to prevent them receiving each
other's answers (unless you can rely on userspace holding the lock until
it is done - which you can't as who trusts userspace?) You could do
something horrible like back off after peeking at the protocol to see
if it might be yours, but even that only works assuming the two are
trying to talk different protocols (talking the same protocol isn't allowed
but no way to enforce that using just pci_cfg_access_lock()).

I can't see a way to tell that the DOE might not have responded to an
earlier request.  DOE busy indicates the write mailbox register cannot
receive data at the moment.  If it's set then there is a message in
flight, but if it is not set there might still be a message in flight.
Busy only indicates if the write mailbox register can sink a request
which doesn't in general tell us anything about the underlying state.

So if userspace sent a request then quit.  Kernel driver would have
no way of knowing if the next response was due to the request it sent
or some earlier one (other than matching IDs)  Note you aren't allowed
to have multiple requests for a single protocol in flight at the same
time.  With just a lock you would have no way of preventing this.

So we are back to every request the kernel sent having to be proceeded
by an abort and potentially a 1 second delay whilst some chunk of the
device firmware reboots.

This came up in dicussion when Dan proposed the patch
[PATCH] PCI: Allow drivers to claim exclusive access to config regions
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/161663543465.1867664.5674061943008380442.stgit@dwillia2-desk3.amr.corp.intel.com/
Summarizing outcome of that thread.

1) Reads of DOE registers are always safe, so we shouldn't stop lspci
and similar accessing config space.
2) You are on your own if any userspace writes to pci config space.
There are loads of ways it can break the system so it doesn't make much
sense to protect against one more.

If there is a reason to provide a userspace interface to a DOE for a
device with a driver attached, then I would agree with Dan's suggestion
to use a proper driver for it.

Dan briefly mentioned that temporary blocking might be needed. I'm guessing
that was to try and let userspace safely use the DOE.

The driver would work fine ignoring busy entirely and would perhaps be
less confusing as a result.  We reset the DOE at startup anyway and that
would clear existing busy.  Any future times busy is set would have no
impact on the flow.

Perhaps it's the comment that caused confusion here. It covered
the next few lines as well. You need to read the first DW to get protocol
(and write it to be able to read the next one back)
The second dw is then need to get to the length which follows this.

I'll split the comment into two parts so that it's clearer what it is referring
to.

On any error here, we end up calling a abort anyway so state on error paths of
the DOE doesn't matter.

Makes sense. I'll add a pci_WARN() here

Don't think it's a bug (single work item) but it's definitely
clearer the other way around.
