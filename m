[+cc Len, Robert in case I'm missing something about static tables
reserving address space]

["My stance" refers to this:

  Static tables like MCFG, HPET, ECDT, etc., are *not* mechanisms for
  reserving address space.  The static tables are for things the OS
  needs to know early in boot, before it can parse the ACPI namespace.
  If a new table is defined, an old OS needs to operate correctly even
  though it ignores the table.  _CRS allows that because it is generic
  and understood by the old OS; a static table does not.

from https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/PCI/acpi-info.rst?id=v6.6#n32]

I don't think this is just my stance.  The ACPI spec could be clearer
in terms of requiring PNP0C02 devices, not static tables, to reserve
address space, but I think that requirement is a logical consequence
of the ACPI design.

It's a goal of ACPI that an OS we release today should run on a
platform released tomorrow.  If the new platform uses a static table
to reserve address space used by some new hardware, today's OS doesn't
know about it and could place another device on top of it.

Using _CRS of an ACPI device to reserve the new hardware address space
is different because it works even with today's OS.  Today's OS can't
*operate* tomorrow's hardware, but at least it won't create address
conflicts with it.

The MCFG requirement for PNP0C02 _CRS has been in the PCI Firmware
spec since r3.0 in 2005.  I'm surprised that vendors still get this
wrong.  Vendors definitely have an interest in making shipping OSes
boot unchanged on new hardware.

The fact that Windows works doesn't mean the firmware is correct.
Linux assigns PCI BARs from the bottom up, and ECAM is often at the
bottom of a host bridge aperture.

Windows assigns PCI BARs from the top down, so even without a _CRS
reservation for the ECAM space, Windows is much less likely to put
something on top of it.
