Hi Björn!,

Apologies for the delay in response. Held up with something else.

Yes, It is only for GSI's.

I am not sure it is a good idea not to support PCI link devices. Not
allowing them removes the flexibility in _PRT. Also, is there a standard
16550 UART apart from PNP0501? ACPI platform devices already support
deferred probe as per the series you mentioned. IMO, PNP also should
support it. So, I am not sure it is a good idea to prohibit all PnP
devices on RISC-V platforms. Other OS's might be able to handle them.

The issue is primarily with APLIC-MSI. Since it needs MSI device domain,
it has to be a platform device.

I am investigating fw-devlink like Marc suggested atleast for IRQ
dependencies. If that works, it would be the best solution.
