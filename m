Well, for me that would be a good enough reason for avoiding to expose it.

If there is no particular reason for exposing any information to user
space, I don't see why it should be exposed at all.

There is some cost of exposing things to user space, so why pay it for
no benefit?

That would be suboptimal for a few reasons:

1. The interface is potentially confusing.  User space would first
need to locate the ACPI device interface corresponding to the given
"real" device in order to use that information.
2. It doesn't scale beyond ACPI.
3. From the ACPI subsystem's perspective the choice of the "relevant"
_PLD fields is arbitrary and exposing all of them is overkill for any
use cases known to me.
4. The ACPI subsystem doesn't know the devices for which _PLD
information should be exposed and there are some devices for which it
is just not useful.

I'm not considering this as a feature.

Well, there is another possible approach: Expose the information
needed to address a particular use case in a way that doesn't strictly
depend on ACPI and make this use ACPI as a backend.  Don't worry about
the DT side of things.  If the generic interface is there and it is
suitable enough, DT will be in the receiving end position with much
less of a freedom to introduce a new interface for the same purpose.

On the other hand, if _PLD information is exposed in an ACPI-specific
way, it is almost guaranteed that there will be a DT-specific
interface for the same thing and utilities wanting to be generic will
need to support both of them which will be extra pain.  Some of them
will choose to support the DT-specific interface only and we'll end up
with utilities that can't be used on ACPI-based systems because of
incompatible interfaces.  Been there already.  Thanks, but no thanks!
