I have tested the series on a server machine with HBM (pure HBM, not
attached to a GPU).  Where, HBM is placed in a higher tier than DRAM.

What's your requirements for memory tiers on the machine?  I guess you
want to put GPU attache HBM in a higher tier and put DRAM in a lower
tier.  So, cold HBM pages can be demoted to DRAM when there are memory
pressure on HBM?  This sounds reasonable from GPU point of view.

The above requirements may be satisfied via calculating abstract
distance based on access0 (or combined with access1).  But I suspect
this will be a general solution.  I guess that any memory devices that
are used mainly by the memory initiators other than CPUs want to put
themselves in a higher memory tier than DRAM, regardless of its
access0.

One solution is to put GPU HBM in the highest memory tier (with smallest
abstract distance) always in GPU device driver regardless its HMAT
performance attributes.  Is it possible?
