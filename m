Powerful, frightening, and questionably worthwhile when there are
already examples of commands that need extra coordination for whatever
reason. However, I still think the decision tilts towards allowing
this given ongoing spec work.

NVDIMM ended up allowing unfettered vendor passthrough given the lack
of an organizing body to unify vendors. CXL on the other hand appears
to have more gravity to keep vendors honest. A WARN splat with a
taint, and a debugfs knob for the truly problematic commands seems
sufficient protection of system integrity while still following the
Linux ethos of giving system owners enough rope to make their own
decisions.

It might be worthwhile to make RAW support a compile time decision so
that Linux distros can only ship support for the commands the CXL
driver-dev community has blessed, but I'll leave it to a distro
developer to second that approach.
