Hi Jason,

Thanks for your feedback.

I am considering that the device driver owner will know a lot more
device internal knowledge, e.g. why it needs to reserve this and that
register where the PCI layer might not know much about the internal
device behavior.

OK. Let me rework the V2 with your approach.

We can still preserve every thing then work backwards to preserve
less.  As I said, I will rework V2 with your approach preserving bare
minimum as the starting place.

I know what register is causing the trouble but I think we are under a
different philosophy of addressing the problem from different ends.
Another consideration is the device testing matrixs. The kexec with
device liveupdate is a rare event. With that many device state
re-initializing might trigger some very rare bug in the device or
firmware. So it might be due to the device internal implementation,
even though PCI spec might say otherwise or undefined.

Anyway, let me do it your way in V2 then.

With the V1 the patch series deliverable is having an Intel diorite
NVMe device preserve every config space access and pass to the vfio
and iommu people to build the vfio and iommu on top of it. Let's
forget about V1.

With V2 I want to start with the minimal end. No switches,P2P, ATS or
PASID. I need some help to define what is deliverable in such a
minimal preserve. e.g. Do I be able to read back the config value not
changed then call it a day. Or do I expect to see the device fully
initialized, it is able to be used by the user space. Will the device
need to perform any DMA? Interrupt?

I will probably find a device as simple as possible and it is attached
to the root PCI host bridge, not the PCI-PCI bridge.
Maybe no interrupt as the first step. One possibility is using the
Intel DSA device that does the DMA streaming.

If you have any other feedback on the candidate device and deliverable
test for V2, I am looking forward to it.

Thanks.

Chris
