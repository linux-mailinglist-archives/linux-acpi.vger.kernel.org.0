Okay, then the resource_*() may make more sense, indeed.

They are specifically named in  capital letters, so main use is in static
assignments, but they are made compound literals, so it's possible to
initialise the on-stack or on-heap at run-time with this be kept in mind.
That's why there is nothing hidden, it implies that the struct is fully
assigned (with the provided fields and some defaults).

Yeah, seems not everybody aware of the difference with
foo_init_something() vs. FOO_INIT_SOMETHING() :-)
