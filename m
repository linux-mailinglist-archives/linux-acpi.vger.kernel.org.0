Hi Marc,

Thank you very much for the feedback!. Sure, let me revert this approach
and do as you recommended in next version.

Since we created swnode for root irqchip also in this approach, we had
to support early creation. With your feedback, this is no longer
required.

In Anup's AIA v7 series, he has made non-primary controller drivers as
platform drivers which are not probed early.
