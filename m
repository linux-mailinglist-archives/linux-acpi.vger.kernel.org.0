If Tianocore is the payload, it is either implemented as a EFI app, in
which case it has access to EFI services, or it is not, in which case
it doesn't care about UEFI semantics of the existing reserved regions,
and it only needs to know which regions exist and which of those are
reserved.

And I think the same applies to all other rows in your table: either
the existence of UEFI needs to be carried forward, which needs to be
done via EFI services, or it doesn't, in which case the UEFI specific
reservations can be dropped, and only reserved and available memory is
relevant.

But not UEFI runtime code, right? If the payload is not UEFI based,
the OS would never be able to call that runtime code unless it is
described in a different, non-UEFI way. This is fine, but it is not
UEFI so we shouldn't call it UEFI runtime memory.

What I am questioning is why a memory map with UEFI semantics is even
relevant when those boot services do not exist.

Could you be more specific about why a payload would have to be aware
of the existence of UEFI boot/runtime service regions if it does not
consume the UEFI interfaces of the platform init? And if the payload
exposes UEFI services to the OS, why would it consume a memory map
with UEFI semantics rather than a simple list of memblocks and memory
reservations?

Again, I am inclined to treat this as a firmware implementation
detail, and the OS must never consume this binding. But I am still
puzzled about what exact purpose it is expected to serve.
