Super-nit: that one should probably be just "Arm" as well, but then this 
whole section appears to be erroneous - I don't see anything in mainline 
obviously setting ACPI_OS_NAME to anything other than the ACPICA default 
of "Microsoft Windows NT", and there is no "acpi_os=" parameter - so it 
seems futile to worry about the trivialities within.
