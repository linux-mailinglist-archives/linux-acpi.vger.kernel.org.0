Hi Rafael again,

Sorry for the silly question here. I misunderstood your comment a bit,
but I talked to Benson and Prashant for clarification. I understand
now what you mean by it is not an ACPI-specific problem and exposing
PLD would depend on ACPI.

I am still curious what you and Heikki think about this since it may
not be a Type C specific issue. We can start from adding generic
location info to Type C subsystem first, as you suggested, then
consider how to do the same for USB devices and Type A ports
afterwards. I would appreciate sharing any thoughts or feedback. Thank
you very much!
