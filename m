Note this crash is present before any of the patches in this series, but
as explained below it is highly unlikely anyone is shipping a firmware that
causes it. Tests were done using an overriden SRAT.

On ARM64, the gic-v3 driver directly parses SRAT to locate GIC Interrupt
Translation Service (ITS) Affinity Structures. This is done much later
in the boot than the parses of SRAT which identify proximity domains.

As a result, an ITS placed in a proximity domain that is not defined by
another SRAT structure will result in a NUMA node that is not completely
configured and a crash.

ITS [mem 0x202100000-0x20211ffff]
ITS@0x0000000202100000: Using ITS number 0
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 0000000000001a08

ACPI 6.3 allows any set of Affinity Structures in SRAT to define a proximity
domain.  However, as we do not see this crash, we can conclude that no
firmware is currently placing an ITS in a node that is separate from
those containing memory and / or processors.

We could modify the SRAT parsing behavior to identify the existence
of Proximity Domains unique to the ITS structures, and handle them as
a special case of a generic initiator (once support for those merges).

This patch avoids the complexity that would be needed to handle this corner
case, by not allowing the ITS entry parsing code to instantiate new NUMA
Nodes.  If one is encountered that does not already exist, then NO_NUMA_NODE
is assigned and a warning printed just as if the value had been greater than
allowed NUMA Nodes.

"SRAT: Invalid NUMA node -1 in ITS affinity"

Whilst this does not provide the full flexibility allowed by ACPI,
it does fix the problem.  We can revisit a more sophisticated solution if
needed by future platforms.

Change is simply to replace acpi_map_pxm_to_node with pxm_to_node reflecting
the fact a new mapping is not created.
