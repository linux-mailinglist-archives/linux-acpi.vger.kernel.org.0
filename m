So I just went outside for a stroll and realized that:

1. The touchpad and thunderbolt hotplug issues are all happening on
devices booting in EFI mode.

2. The X1 carbon gen 2 from the regression is booting in classic BIOS mode

3. The old devices for which the remove_e820_regions() was originally added
to resolve an issue where there was overlap between the PCI bridge mmio
window and RAM are so old that they only supports classic BIOS boot

4. The problem which we are seeing is coming from the EFI memmap to
e820 reservation table which is only done when booting in EFI mode.

So I believe that there actually is a pretty simple and straight forward
fix for this:

diff --git a/arch/x86/kernel/resource.c b/arch/x86/kernel/resource.c
index 9b9fb7882c20..18656f823764 100644
--- a/arch/x86/kernel/resource.c
+++ b/arch/x86/kernel/resource.c
@@ -28,6 +28,10 @@ static void remove_e820_regions(struct resource *avail)
 	int i;
 	struct e820_entry *entry;
 
+	/* Only remove E820 reservations on classic BIOS boot */
+	if (efi_enabled(EFI_MEMMAP))
+		return;
+
 	for (i = 0; i < e820_table->nr_entries; i++) {
 		entry = &e820_table->entries[i];
 
I'll go and ask the reporters of both the regression as well as of the
original touchpad issue to test this.

Regards,

Hans
