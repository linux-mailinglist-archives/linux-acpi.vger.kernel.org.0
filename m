3 is not just architecture specific code, it's architecture and action spec=
ific.
i.e. What is done in there should not happen in the present path.

=46rom what is in [2] I became much less convinced much code should be shared=
..
Lightly editing where that thread went today, there is some shared code in
the make_present / make_enabled path, but not that much.
As per that discussion, cpu_maps_update* is harmless, but also pointless
and potentially misleading in the enable case.

static int acpi_processor_make_present(struct acpi_processor *pr)
{
        unsigned long long sta;
        acpi_status status;
        int ret;

        if (!IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_ACPI_HOTPLUG_CPU)) {
                pr_err_once("Changing CPU present bit is not supported\n");
                return -ENODEV;
        }

// The _STA check here is needed still or we need to push it into
// arch_register_cpu() on x86 similarly to proposal on arm64.

	status =3D acpi_evaluate_integer(pr->handle, "_STA", NULL, &sta);
        if (ACPI_FAILURE(status) || !(sta & ACPI_STA_DEVICE_PRESENT))
                return -ENODEV;

        if (invalid_phys_cpuid(pr->phys_id))
                return -ENODEV;
        cpu_maps_update_begin();
        cpus_write_lock();

        ret =3D acpi_map_cpu(pr->handle, pr->phys_id, pr->acpi_id, &pr->id);
        if (ret)
                goto out;

        ret =3D arch_register_cpu(pr->id);
        if (ret) {
                acpi_unmap_cpu(pr->id);
                goto out;
        }

        /* =20

        pr_info("CPU%d has been hot-added\n", pr->id);
        pr->flags.need_hotplug_init =3D 1;

out:
        cpus_write_unlock();
        cpu_maps_update_done();
        return ret;
}

        cpus_write_unlock();

        return ret;

I haven't looked as much at the remove path recently but for the enable path
the code that should run in the enable path is much less than in the presen=
t path.

I think that makes it non bisectable, so you can't do this.  Either don't m=
ove
that code until after the next patch, or squash the 2 together.

Less important in an RFC though,
