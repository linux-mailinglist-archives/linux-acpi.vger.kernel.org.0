Then how about naming it "use_iommu" or something like that?  "Trust"
has nothing to do with this at all.

Why is this relevant?

Then let us mark these as "able to do DMA" or something like that.
"Trust" is a userspace policy decision, not a kernel decision to make.

And there are other busses that can do DMA, PCI is not unique here.

That's fine, let's move it there.

Because of the issues I am raising here.  It's a bad name and doesn't
mean what people think it means.

So I guess no one really cares :)

Why does Chromeos care about this flag?  What userspace decisions do you
make based on it?

It needs those code changes, please do not try to keep adding more to
this to avoid the real-work that is needed here.  Refer to those other
discussions you mention above for what should happen to do this
correctly.
