What do you see being mixed together here?  I acknowledge that the
name of "pdev->untrusted" is probably a mistake.  But this patch
doesn't change anything there.  It only changes the treatment of the
edge case of the "ExternalFacing" ports.  Previously we treated them
as being external themselves, which does seem wrong.
