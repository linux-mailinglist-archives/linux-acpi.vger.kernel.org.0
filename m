I tried a little harder to get _some_ difference on 32-bit, and
managed to get one by doing i386_defconfig and then switching off
modules to make all M into Y, and then compared sizes:

vmlinux: 25590780 -> 25598972, so a 0.032% increase.
bzImage: 8698944 -> 8699424, so a 0.0055% increase.

So it does increase, ever so slightly, but a) on 32-bit, and b) a
super, super tiny amount.

In other words, I still think this patch is very much a-okay. But very
eager to hear from Rafael on the approach.

Jason
