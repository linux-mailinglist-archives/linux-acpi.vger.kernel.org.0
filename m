Hi Rafael,

I rebased the vCPU HP series Russell was working to go on top of this
and give me a basis to check the flows through your new conditions.
It may have it's own issues, but at least it makes use of some of these
bits and related checks.

For now the only key thing is make sure we don't check enabled()
in the hot remove path (until after _EJ0).  That happens correctly
because acpi_device_trim() is called and that doesn't have check_status
set.  The naming however doesn't make it obvious that path elides the
check, so I wonder if that call in acpi_scan_hotremove()
should be replaced with acpi_bus_trim_one(, NULL);

This feels like an 'and' kind of a patch. Can we split it up so refactors
are done first and the _STA check stuff in a follow up patch?

End result is good, just could possibly be easier to review in two hops.

Diff had a field day here and generated an somewhat unreadable patch.

A few other comments inline, but superficial stuff. The handling looks
correct to me.

Bool as pointer is a bit hard to read particularly as you use (void *)true
for true, but not (void *)false for false.

However it's not too bad.  My current version of the vCPU patches needs
to pass more data in here anyway (as there a few things we need to
not do on eject, that don't correspond to !check_status)
so I have this as a struct anyway after a rebase.

The name of this had me initially a little confused.  Maybe
acpi_bus_trim_if_gone()

Or maybe just drop this wrapper entirely as it doesn't save much
and naming it clearly is hard.

This resolves as (present or functional) && enabled.

By my reading you are not allowed functional && enabled, but not present.
Line one of the description says.

"If bit [0] is cleared, then bit 1 must also be cleared (in other words, a device that is not present cannot be enabled)."

I don't much care about that though (I think we discussed this
in Russel's earlier series)
