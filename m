Using -1 makes sense when we have no direct visibility of the mentioned array.
Here we have it visible and statically defined, hence the ARRAY_SIZE() is more
appropriate.

Strictly speaking the acpi_dev_free_resource_list() still needs to be called
on 0 return as it's called only for the error cases.

I think this is the first and the only time I see a combined comparison <= 0
for the acpi_dev_get_resources().

We have resource_type() helper.

And I believe the direct comparison in this case is better.
