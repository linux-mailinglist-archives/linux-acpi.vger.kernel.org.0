Greetings My Dear,

    I sent this mail praying it will found you in a good condition of
health, since I myself are in a very critical health

condition in which I  sleep every night without knowing if I may be
alive to see the next day. I am Mrs. Monika John

 Carlsen from Denmark wife of late Mr John Carlsen, a widow suffering
from long time illness. I have some funds I

inherited from my late husband, the sum of (eleven million dollars) my
Doctor told me recently that I have serious

sickness which is cancer problem. What disturbs me most is my stroke
sickness. Having known my condition, I

decided to donate this fund to a good person that will utilize it the
way i am going to instruct herein. I need a very

honest and God fearing person who can claim this money and use it for
Charity works, for orphanages, widows

and also  build schools for less privileges that will be named after
my late husband if possible and to promote the

word of God and the effort that the house of God is maintained.

I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly
manner. That's why I'm taking this decision.

I'm not afraid of death so I know where I'm going. I accept this
decision because I do not have any child who will

inherit this money after I die. Please I want your sincerely and
urgent answer to know if you will be able to

execute this project, and I will give you more information on how the
fund will be transferred to your bank

account. I am waiting for your reply.

May God Bless you,
Mrs. Monika John  Carlsen
