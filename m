If you get in the habit of using the commit reference style from
Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst it saves me the trouble
of fixing them.  I use this:

  gsr is aliased to `git --no-pager show -s --abbrev-commit --abbrev=12 --pretty=format:"%h (\"%s\")%n"'

That's exactly the sort of assertion I was looking for.  If we can get
something like this explanation into the commit log, and if Ashok and
Alex are OK with this, we'll be much closer.

It sounds like this is just enforcing a restriction we already have,
i.e., enabling PCI_ACS_TB blocks translated requests from devices that
aren't supposed to be generating them.

You mean the "pci=noats" kernel command line parameter, right?

I think this would be new functionality that we don't have today, and
we don't have anything that actually *needs* it AFAIK, so I wouldn't
bother.
