Hi Willï¼Œ

HiSilicon Kunpeng920's ZIP/SEC/HPRE engines(drivers/crypto/hisilicon/) are using
stall mode.

UACCE driver(drivers/misc/uacce/) is used to export these engines to user space.
A user space library: https://github.com/Linaro/uadk offers APIs to help users
to use these engines.

In fact, we only need a quirk(https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/3/8/1506) based on this
IOPF series to make whole solution mainline ready. So please also take this
patch, we need it! :)

Best,
Zhou
