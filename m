OK, because ECAM config access has intrinsic atomic primitive, so no need to
reserve those ECAM config space resources for APEI, that's why commit d91525eb8ee6 
("ACPI, EINJ: Enhance error injection tolerance level") fix make sense...

OK, understood. Since those platforms are not really ACPI-compliant, so
we can unify all the quirks together. Let me send an inital solution about
this for your review and see if there's room for further improvement...
