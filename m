Here the fake pci device has standard PCI cfg space, but physical 
implementation is base on AMBA
They can provide pasid feature.
However,
1, does not support tlp since they are not real pci devices.
2. does not support pri, instead support stall (provided by smmu)
And stall is not a pci feature, so it is not described in struct 
pci_dev, but in struct iommu_fwspec.
So we use this fixup to tell pci system that the devices can support 
stall, and hereby support pasid.

Thanks
