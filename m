ACPI on ARM64 requires a set of HW components described in the SBSA.

If those HW requirements are not fulfilled you can't bootstrap an ARM64
system with ACPI - it is as simple as that. It is not even appropriate
to discuss this on a Linux mailing list anymore since it is HW
requirements and it has been public information since ACPI on ARM64 was
first enabled.

Because you don't have to maintain it ;) - I think I said what I had to
say about the MCFG mechanism in the past - it has been three years
and counting - it is time to remove it rather that adding to it.

I am not trying to achieve anything - I am just stating public
information - let me repeat it again for interested readers: to
bootstrap an ARM64 system with ACPI the platform HW design must follow
the SBSA guidelines.

Booting with a device tree ?

We will bootstrap next generation Tegra with ACPI then, there are
SBSA tests available for compliancy - again, that's a matter for
Nvidia and Arm to settle, not a mailing list discussion.

What does this mean ? Should I wreck the upstream kernel to make it boot
with ACPI on *any* ARM64 platform out there then ?

My stance is clear above and the ACPI PCI programming model - inclusive
of firmware - has been there since ACPI was deployed, if ACPI support
is required HW must comply, either that or it is out of tree patches
and I can't be blamed for that.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
