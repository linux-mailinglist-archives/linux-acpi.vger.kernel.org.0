Thanks for catching the holes. It broke somewhere in the earlier RFC changes.

I don't think we need to size or version. Reserved fields are good enough near
term future proofing and if we get to a point where the command is woefully
incompetent, I think it'd be time to just make cxl_send_command2.

Generally, I think cxl_send_command is fairly future proof because it's so
simple. As you get more complex, you might need better mechanisms, like deferred
command completion for example. It's unclear to me whether we'll get to that
point though, and if we do, I think a new command is warranted.
