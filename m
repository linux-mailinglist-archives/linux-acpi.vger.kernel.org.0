So this basically means

if (sleep_state < ACPI_STATE_S14)
        ACPI_FLUSH_CPU_CACHE();

and analogously below.

This is fine with me, but it is an ACPICA patch, so it needs to be
submitted to the upstream project.  I think I can take care of this,
but not urgently.

And this is independent of the ACPICA changes above, so it can be made
in a separate patch.

This one is somewhat risky, though, because there is no guarantee that
all of the platforms in the field follow the spec.

This flushing and the one below looks like it may be redundant,
because the cache will be flushed again in the ACPICA code above
anyway.

However, this needs to be double-checked.

This one is OK and can be done in a separate patch.
