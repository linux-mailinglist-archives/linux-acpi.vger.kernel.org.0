I thought this was for non-EFI based systems. Confused.

ePAPR is the source of DT Spec. That was mainly FSL PPC, not IBM PPC.
There's something called SPAPR, but no public spec. Otherwise, it's
looking at arch/powerpc in the kernel.

Both are defining regions of memory to pass from one stage to the
next. Isn't that the same thing?

Perhaps it is easiest if firmware removes its private stuff. You can
put whatever you want into a DT and I don't care if it's not an ABI
between the components. You may still want to document things and have
a schema for other reasons.

What you need is $nodename should be "memory-map", not "/". There is
not a way to say it has to be under the root node other than adding it
to root-node.yaml.

The DT Spec. :)

The schema is in the kernel currently in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reserved-memory/reserved-memory.yaml.
I need to move it out.

There's some precedence for other things already. The spec defines the
"hotpluggable" property. lshw will parse some DIMM properties which I
think date back to PowerMacs.
