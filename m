exactly. I am running with this workaround for a while now and never
had any fails with it anymore. The GPU gets turned off correctly and I
see the same power savings, just that the GPU can be powered on again.

afaik when I was talking with others in the past about it, Windows is
doing that before using ACPI calls, but maybe they have some similar
workarounds for certain intel bridges as well? I am sure it affects
more than the one I am blacklisting here, but I rather want to check
each device before blacklisting all kabylake and sky lake bridges (as
those are the ones were this issue can be observed).

Sadly we had no luck getting any information about such workaround out
of Nvidia or Intel.
