It is used on the other side.  That is, the value assigned to the trip
field in it is accessed via trip_ref in the driver.

The idea is that the driver puts a pointer to its local struct
thermal_trip_ref into a struct thermal_trip and the core stores the
address of that struct thermal_trip in there, which allows the driver
to access the struct thermal_trip via its local struct
thermal_trip_ref going forward.

Admittedly, this is somewhat convoluted.

I have an alternative approach in the works, just for illustration
purposes if nothing else, but I have encountered a problem that I
would like to ask you about.

Namely, zone disabling is not particularly useful for preventing the
zone from being used while the trips are updated, because it has side
effects.  First, it triggers __thermal_zone_device_update() and a
netlink message every time the mode changes, which can be kind of
overcome.  But second, if the mode is "disabled", it does not actually
prevent things like __thermal_zone_get_trip() from running and the
zone lock is the only thing that can be used for that AFAICS.

So by "disabling" a thermal zone, did you mean changing its mode to
"disabled" or something else?
