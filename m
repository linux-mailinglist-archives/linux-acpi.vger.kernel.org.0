So it's a simple, single core running very early after power-on, when the actual AP cores are still off. The SError handler is set to just increase a value, then to return. This value is then checked before and after a config space access for a given

That means we can't attribute this anymore to the faulting instruction, we don't even know if it happened due to this config space access. The CPU might have executed later instructions already, so the state is broken at this point. SError basically means: the system is screwed up.

Furthermore, on the main application processor, SError might be 
delivered to EL3 firmware well beyond the reach of Linux, so we can make 
zero assumptions about how it's handled and whether we'll ever see it, 
or survive the result (EL3 is at liberty to say "oh, something went 
wrong, I'll reset the system immediately").
