Yeah, it's probably not a configuration that anyone would actually want 
to use in anger on Keystone itself, but as long as folks might have 
ARCH_KEYSTONE selected in their non-LPAE multiplatform config we should 
avoid build regressions. I did wonder if Keystone should simply have a 
hard dependency on LPAE, but there does appear to be some explicit 
support for running directly from the non-coherent low 2G alias :/
