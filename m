Ah understood.

If we do this we effectively end up with 3 different types of walk and
the meaning of the walk function gets more complex again.

1) Normal bus walk - we pass the downstream port above a bus to which
the device is attached and it walks everthing below that point.

2) Case I care about RCiEP with no visible association with an RCEC as
I don't need to walk devices.  In that case just calls the callbacks for
the actual device.

3) Pass in RCiEP with RCEC asociated with it (or do a dance at the caller
to pass in the RCEC itself). Need to walk the devices that the RCEC is
handling errors for.  For handling, I'm not all the calls will be generally
applicable to other devices associated with the RCEC as some only make
sense if there is an actual PCIe bus involved and hence we need to reset
other devices on that bus.  For RCEC I don't think there is an particular
reason to assume an AER error reported at one RCiEP will have any impact
on other devices associated with the particular RCEC.
I've not found anything in the spec addressing this question but perhaps
I've missed something?

However, if the RCEC doesn't support multiple error records, you may need
to walk the bus to identify multiple simultaneous issues, very carefully
avoiding (or least minimizing) race conditions.

Agreed. We would end up with the same splitting of handling paths that
wasn't liked in my v1 patch.   Perhaps we need  single pci_walk_aer_affected
function with a pile of documentation for what it is actually doing?

Even then we may need to have a parameter to indicate a particular callback
should be restricted to devices that share a 'real bus' or not. 

I guess the proof will as ever be in what the code looks like.

Hmm. It increasingly feels like we may need to have a go at drawing together
some coherent documentation for the different ways of handling
AER errors and specifications / assumptions for each.  Would be 'interesting'
to do given I'm fairly sure very few people actually understands all the options and
nasty corner cases!

+CC Lorenzo and James who may also be interested in this topic in general.

Thanks,

Jonathan
