Ok, I'll rename this for the official upstream submission.

Right, just like the flags changes in this RFC getting this fixed
will require some work on the ACPICA side + then Linux changes
using the new ACPICA functions.

Right, that is how it will look like inside ACPICA, but API consumers
will just see a new acpi_install_address_space_handler_no__reg()
getting introduced.

Ack.

acpi_execute_reg_methods() works for me.

I'll try to prepare a new ACPICA pull-req with the discussed
changes + a Linux series on top sometime the coming few weeks.
