But aren't you assuming that the Payload knows how to handle the
hardware and can implement the runtime services? What if (for example)
powering off the device is hardware-specific and only Platform Init
knows how?

On another track, would it help if we just dropped all mention of
UEFI? The binding does not mention it.

On a third track, what if Platform Init wants to set aside some memory
for runtime code, e.g. in SRAM?

I'm just not sure that Platform Init and Payload are as completely
independent as you seem to be suggesting. Once we get into the
Payload, the only things we know are what Platform Init told us.

OK I see. From my POV they seem like binary blobs that are built from
UEFI, but I will try to remember about PI.
