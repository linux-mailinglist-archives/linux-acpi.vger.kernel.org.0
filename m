Say two power resources are listed by _PR3 for one device (because why
not?) and you want to change the device's state to D3cold only if the
two power resources are both "off".  Then, you need some locking (or
equivalent) to synchronize two power resources with each other, so
that you can change the devices state when the last of them goes _OFF.
Currently, there is no such synchronization between power resources
other then the "system_level" value which may not be reliable enough
for this type of use.

Or you can say that the device is in D3cold if at least one of the
power resources is _OFF, but IMO that may not really be consistent
with the view that the "logical" power state of the device should
reflect the physical reality accurately.

I guess what you mean is that the "cached" (or rather "logical" or
"expected") power state value may become different from what is
returned by acpi_device_get_power() for the device.

The problem here is that acpi_device_get_power() really only should be
used for two purposes: (1) To initialize adev->power.state, or to
update it via acpi_device_update_power(), and (2) by the
"real_power_state" sysfs attribute (of ACPI device objects).  The
adev->power.state value should be used anywhere else, in principle, so
the Mika's patch is correct.

[Note that adev->power.state cannot be updated after calling
acpi_device_get_power() to the value returned by it without updating
the reference counters of the power resources that are "on" *exactly*
because of the problem at hand here.]

> but that's just an idle thought, not a suggestion.

After the initialization of the ACPI subsystem, the authoritative
source of the ACPI device power state information is
adev->power.state.  The ACPI subsystem is expected to update this
value as needed going forward (including system-wide transitions like
resume from S3).
