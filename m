Long old post that describes the issue in detail is here:

Great.

What is the max number of groups you can ever have?  10?  100?  1000?
Pick a high number, define them all (macros make this easy), and then
only enable the ones that you need at runtime.

Look at the attribute pointer.  That's all you care about.  Compare it
to a real pointer and away you go!

This whole thing is a new abi :)

Again, you are racing with userspace and loosing.  If you do not mind
userspace not noticing the attributes, fine, leave it as-is, but odds
are you don't want that.
