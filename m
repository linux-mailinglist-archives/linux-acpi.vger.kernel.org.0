Frankly, I’m also waiting for my first “user” to be announced at the moment,
so that I can make the whole picture clearer. And it is why I mark this
patch as an RFC. 

Yes. I admit it is a little weird to add another interrupt controller
between the GIC and INTx device. But if it is not only about
initialization but also about hooking into the INTx processing (e.g.,
introduce an extra ack operation...), it seems we cannot only rely
on FW. I have looked for a FW solution without introducing a new
driver later but failed... I’m happy to be fixed if there is a pure
FW solution.

Thanks.

Baozi.
