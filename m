You're seeing AER logging, and that's what I'm interested in, so if
you could do one quick boot *without* "pci=nomsi" and "pci=noaer",
that would be great.  Then turn it off again so you don't drown in
logs.

The snippet from [1] shows a few messages related to 00:1c.5, and it
would be useful to know if there are errors related to other devices
as well.

Something like "head -c500K /var/log/dmesg > file" should be plenty.

Sure, delete those.

Good point, a new thread would probably be better.
