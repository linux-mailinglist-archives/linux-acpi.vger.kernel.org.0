I agree, changing the order would probably open another can of worms.

Yes.

I think it would still work because now we call pci_bus_size_bridges()
only for non-hotplug bridge which do not have I/O window open so
pbus_size_io() fails to find the "free" I/O resource on that bus and the
kernel then fails to assign that I/O resource for the device.

This is based on reading the code - I cannot verify this on real
hardware, though.
