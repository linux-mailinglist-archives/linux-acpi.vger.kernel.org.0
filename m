I do somewhat agree with your point.

IIUC, ACPI Table parsing can be undertaken from user-space for ACPI
tables that provide error information through sysfs and, if required, MMIO.

Our principal motive though in wanting to add support for this table in the
kernel, and please correct me if I am wrong, was the absence of an open-source
tool to accomplish this. Having support for the table in the kernel should alleviate
users from the need to develop tools and manually run them whence an unexpected
reset is encountered. The data is already available in the dmesg / journal for
analysis and will be available across reboots in the journal.

An alternative for a tool might be using acpidump utility and ASL but even that
can be tedious at times since tables are in little-endian format and users might
be required to undertake byte level decoding of the dumped table by referring
to ACPI specs. Wouldn't having parsed data available in the dmesg, at least,
be convenient in such cases?

Another important motive was the reset reason health record itself. Below is
an excerpt from the ACPI spec v6.5

The reset reason is intended to supplement existing fault reporting mechanisms on the platform (e.g. BERT tables, CPER) or in the operating system (e.g. event logs)

Since existing fault reporting mechanisms log into the dmesg buffer (AFAIK) and
Reset Reason Health Record is intended to supplement them, wouldn't it be fitting
to have the record available in dmesg buffer too and ensure that all error info
is not scattered but available in a single place and across reboots?

Also, I do agree with Mario in that we should set expected reset reasons to
debug. Rather, we could have the entire record as debug for expected resets and
only log to the dmesg for unexpected resets.
