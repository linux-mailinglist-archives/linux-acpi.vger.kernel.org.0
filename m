I generally *like* this, and it does fix some annoying things, but I
think it's a little too much all at once.  If we're working in a file
and doing actual bug fixes or new functionality, and we want to fix
some typos or something at the end, that might be OK, but I think the
churn in the git history outweighs the benefit of this huge patch.

So I would encourage you to use some of the PCI expertise you've
gained by looking at all this code to work on something with a little
more impact.  Here are a couple ideas:

  - There are only two uses of __ref and __refdata in drivers/pci/.
    The fact that they're so rare makes me suspect that we don't need
    them.  But I haven't investigated these to see.  Somebody could
    check that out and remove them if we don't need them.  Be aware
    that I will want a clear argument for why they're not needed :)

  - Coverity complains about several issues in drivers/pci/ [1].  Most
    of the time these are false positives, but not always.  Sometimes
    there's an actual bug, and sometimes there's a way to restructure
    the code to avoid the warning (which usually means doing things
    the same way they are done elsewhere).

  - "make C=2 drivers/pci/" (sparse checker, [2]) complains about a
    few things.  Leave the pci_power_t ones alone for now, but there
    are a couple other type issues that could be cleaned up.
