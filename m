Now, dax/kmem.c is used for

- PMEM (Optane DCPMM, or AEP)
- CXL.mem
- HBM (attached to CPU)

I understand that for a CXL GPU driver it's OK to call some CXL CDAT
helper to identify the abstract distance of memory attached to GPU.
Because there's no cross-subsystem function calls.  But it looks not
very clean to call from dax/kmem.c to CXL CDAT because it's a
cross-subsystem function call.

Yes.  In most cases, there are no overlaps among algorithms.

But we have no way to enforce that too.
