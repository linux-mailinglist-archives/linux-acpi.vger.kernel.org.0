IIUC an abort would mean game over for *every* transaction in flight,
not sure that's the best way of preventing userspace from mingling
but as you mentioned I don't think there is a way around it with the
current protocol.

I don't see how a lock would solve this issue either - how would it ?

Basically you have to stop userspace from issuing requests for the
duration of a request/response (per-protocol) session, right ?
