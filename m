My point is really that by themselves, these regions are not usable by
either a payload or an OS that consumes this information. Unless there
is some other information being provided (via DT I imagine) that
describes how these things are supposed to be used, they are nothing
more than memory reservations that should be honored, and providing
this arbitrary set of labels is unnecessary.

A payload or OS can do nothing with a memory reservation called
'runtime-code' it it doesn't know what is inside. So there is another
DT node somewhere that describes this, and that can simply point to
this region (via a phandle) if it needs to describe the
correspondence. This is more idiomatic for DT afaik (but I am not the
expert).  But more importantly, it avoids overloading some vague
labels with behavior (e.g., executable permissions for code regions)
that should only be displayed for regions with a particular use,
rather than for a ill defined class of reservations the purpose of
which is not clear.

What I am trying to avoid is the OS ending up being forced to consume
this information in parallel to the EFI memory map, and having to
reconcile them. I'd be much happier if this gets contributed to a spec
that only covers firmware-to-firmware, and is prevented from leaking
into the OS facing interface.
