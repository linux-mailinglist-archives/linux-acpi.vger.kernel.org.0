Hmm, actually, ACPI_ID_LEN wasn't used outside of
linux/mod_device_table.h before 6543becf26ff, so changing it at that
point was fine.

I do wonder how much code is out there that blindly assumes the ACPI
core will never deliver more than 8 bytes' worth of _HID/_CID, and
subsequently runs off the end of a statically sized buffer.
