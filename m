That's likely what would happen.
The same issue should apply to native PCIe and SHPC hotplug, as they also u=
se
pci_assign_unassigned_bridge_resources().

Perhaps drivers have to be taught that PCI tree is being reconfigured or so=
me
another approach can be used to deal with it.
Do you have any ideas?

I'm comparing with Windows guest, which manages to reconfigure PCI hierarchy
on the fly. (though I haven't tested that under heavy load with several
devices on a bridge).
