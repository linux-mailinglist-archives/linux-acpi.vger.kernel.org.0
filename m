ACPI is a subsystem, so it's OK for dax/kmem to depends on CONFIG_ACPI.
But HMAT is a driver of ACPI subsystem (controlled via
CONFIG_ACPI_HMAT).  It's not good for a driver of DAX subsystem
(dax/kmem) to depend on a *driver* of ACPI subsystem.

Yes.  Technically, there's no hard wall to prevent this.  But I think
that a good design should make drivers depends on subsystems or drivers
of the same subsystem, NOT drivers of other subsystems.
