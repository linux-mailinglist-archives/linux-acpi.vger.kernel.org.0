In retrospect, I think 8fd4391ee717 (which I wrote), was probably a
mistake.

Sure, it's a nice idea to have PNP0A03 _CRS methods that work nicely
as designed, by describing host bridge registers as "consumer"
resources and host bridge windows as "producer" registers, instead of
having the bridge registers in _CRS of an unrelated PNP0C02 device.

But realistically, the PNP0A03/PNP0C02 issue is a solved problem, even
though it's ugly, and I'm not sure why I thought Microsoft would see
value in doing this differently on arm64 than on x86 and ia64.

What would break if we reverted 8fd4391ee717?  I guess any arm64
platforms that described host bridge register space in PNP0A03 _CRS
"consumer" resources?  And Windows probably doesn't work or isn't
supported on those platforms?
