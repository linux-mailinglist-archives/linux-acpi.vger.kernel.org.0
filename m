That sounds reasonable.  I assume that if we skip the clipping for
every platform that matches "IIL", we can also add exceptions for the
inevitable "IIL" platforms that do need the clip?  E.g., specific
entries at the end of the list that override the previous generic
match?

That's a good point and sounds fairly painful when that happens,
but I don't see a nice way out of this.

I think we need a long-term strategy that can be clearly expressed 
in a sentence or two and is consistent with the ACPI and PCI specs,
and I don't think the current strategy is it.  Clipping with E820
regions happened to work for some machines, but there's no reason to
think it will work in general.
