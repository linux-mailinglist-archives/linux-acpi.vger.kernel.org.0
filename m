I can't see any connection between this bug and acpi/sysfs.c.  Is it a 
bad bisection?

It looks like you're right about dev_set_name() failing.  In fact, the 
kernel appears to be littered with calls to that routine which do not 
check the return code (the entire subtree below drivers/usb/ contains 
only _one_ call that does check the return code!).  The function doesn't 
have any __must_check annotation, and its kerneldoc doesn't mention the 
return code or the possibility of a failure.

Apparently the assumption is that if dev_set_name() fails then 
device_add() later on will also fail, and the problem will be detected 
then.

So now what should happen when device_add() for an interface fails in 
usb_set_configuration()?  I guess the interface should be deleted; 
otherwise we have the possibility that people might still try to access 
it via usbfs, as in the syzbot test run.  Same goes for the 
of_device_is_available() check.

Fixing that will be a little painful.  Right now there are plenty of 
places in the USB core that aren't prepared to cope with a non-existent 
interface.
