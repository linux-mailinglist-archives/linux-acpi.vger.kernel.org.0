If you have a suggestion for ID values that correspond to the h/w,
then we can add them. I'd like a bit more than just trusting that ID
is something real.

While the ACPI folks may be willing to take an arbitrary index, it's
something we (mostly) avoid for DT.

AIUI, cache ids break the compact representation.
