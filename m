We have three cases:

  1) CONFIG_PCIEASPM=y

     Linux allocates ASPM link_state for downstream ports and manages
     ASPM.

  2) CONFIG_PCIEASPM=y and booted with "pcie_aspm=off"

     aspm_support_enabled is false, so Linux does not allocate ASPM
     link_state and does not manage ASPM.  There is no way to change
     aspm_support_enabled at runtime.  pcie_aspm_get_link() always
     returns NULL, so ASPM cannot be enabled by drivers or by the
     sysfs knobs (aspm_ctrl_attrs[]).

  3) CONFIG_PCIEASPM is unset

     aspm.c is not even compiled, so ASPM cannot be enabled by drivers
     or sysfs.

Currently we set OSC_PCI_ASPM_SUPPORT only for case 1.  This patch
would set it for both case 1 and case 2.

But I think case 2 and case 3 are indistinguishable from the
platform's point of view.  The only difference is that case 2 includes
some ASPM code in the image that can never be used.

I think part of the motivation for this patch is that we'd like AER,
hotplug, etc to work even in case 2.  We could make an argument for
doing that, but then AER and hotplug should work even in case 3.

If we want to do that, I think we should do it head-on by relaxing
this test in os_control_query_checks():

  if ((support & ACPI_PCIE_REQ_SUPPORT) != ACPI_PCIE_REQ_SUPPORT) {
    decode_osc_support(root, "not requesting OS control; OS requires",
		       ACPI_PCIE_REQ_SUPPORT);
    return false;
  }
