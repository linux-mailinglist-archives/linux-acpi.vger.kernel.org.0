I think you interpret rev 6 as a global revision of the platform,
i.e., the platform supports rev 6 for every function it implements in
this UUID (which is clearly the intent of the ACPI ASL example).

I suggest that it would be better to interpret the revision
individually for each function because it removes the backwards
compatibility assumption and reduces the testing burden.

Most functions would be specified and implemented with rev 0, and
would never have a rev 1.  There would only be a rev 1 of a function
if we made a non backwards compatible change to it.

Any other functions would be untouched, and they would still only
support rev 0, not rev 1.

I don't think it's reasonable to require the person adding support for
Fn 0xE rev 6 (TLP Processing Hints) to go back and add Fn 0xC rev 6
(Downstream Port Containment) at the same time.

Assuming that "rev X works the same as rev X-1 and therefore rev X
doesn't need to be tested" seems unwise to me.  But even if we
normally rely on that assumption, in this case Fn 0xC rev 5 and rev 6
are different, so we'd be adding new code that would require testing
on every platform that supports rev 6 of any function.

In such a case, the backwards compatibility assumption doesn't apply
to those functions, so the spec would have to document multiple
revisions of them, and IMO that's the natural place to document
a requirement to use the same revision for the set.
