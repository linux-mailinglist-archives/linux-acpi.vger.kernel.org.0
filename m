No worries - this code is pretty confusing!

Looking at one of the others like ghes_notify_sea() might be simpler.
The lock protects the fixmap slot, in case the notification occurs on multiple CPUs.

notify_nmi is weird as it has this atomic_add_unless() which seems to throw away some of
the CPUs if they arrive ~together. It was added by commit 6fe9e7c26a971 ("GHES: Make NMI
handler have a single reader"), which describes the motivation.

I'm not familiar with how x86 CPUs trigger NMI. From the commit message I've assumed this
means there is some broadcast source of NMI, that is never firmware-first. I thought the
trip via SMM for firmware-first did 'something' to hold the other CPUs so only one CPU
takes the NMI - but I couldn't find it last time I went looking.

As I've no idea how this works, I decided not to change it. I added the spinlock so that
the the fixmap slot provided to ghes_in_nmi_spool_from_list() is always protected by a
spinlock, but the atomic means that for notify_nmi, the lock will never be contended.



Thanks,

James
