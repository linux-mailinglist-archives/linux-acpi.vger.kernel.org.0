Can you clarify what you mean by 'wrecked'? AFAIK a valid, if poorly 
chosen, steering tag is going to be sub-optimal performance.

I'm under the impression this is a similar problem to cpu/irq/numa 
affinity where the driver/subsystem should be making the choice, but the 
user is provided the opportunity to override the defaults if they think 
there is benefit in their environment. Again AFAIK, the whole 
OS/software stashing is already well down the 'I know better than the HW 
where to store this data' rabbit hole.


Thanks,
