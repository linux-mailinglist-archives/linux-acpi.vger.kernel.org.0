Well it explains those methods, _PSx, _PRx and _ON()/_OFF(). In case of
PCIe device you also want to check PCIe spec. PCIe 5.0 section 5.8 "PCI
Function Power State Transitions" has a picture about the supported
power state transitions and there we can find that function must be in
D3hot before it can be transitioned into D3cold so if the _OFF() for
example blindly assumes that the device is in D0 when it is called, it
is a bug in the BIOS.

BTW, where can I find acpidump of such system?
