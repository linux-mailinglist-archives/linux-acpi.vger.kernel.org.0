I'm happy to help flesh this out, but you still have not provided us
with an actual use case, so I can only draw from my own experience
putting together firmware for virtual and physical ARM machines.

All the ACPI and UEFI lingo needs to be dropped. This is relevant only
to the OS, and only if the prior stage exposes UEFI interfaces, in
which case it does not need this binding.

So on one side, there is the requirement for each memory reservation
to be described with sufficient detail so that a subsequent boot stage
(firmware or OS) can use it for its intended purpose, provided that
this boot stage is aware of its purpose (i.e., it has a driver that
matches on the compatible string in question, and actually maps/uses
the memory)

On the other side, we need to describe how a memory reservation should
be treated if the boot stage doesn't know its purpose, has no interest
in using it or has consumed the contents and has no longer a need for
the region. We already have no-map to describe that the memory should
never be mapped (and this may be disregarded by an actual driver for
the region). I imagine we might add 'discardable' as a boolean DT
property, meaning that stage N may use the memory whichever way it
wants if it is not going to use it for its intended purpose, provided
that it deletes the node from the DT before passing it on to stage
N+1.

One thing that needs to be clarified is how this binding interacts
with /memory nodes. I assume that currently, /reserved-memory is
independent, i.e., it could describe mappable memory that is not
covered by /memory at all. If this is the case, we have to decide
whether or not discardable regions can be treated in the same way, or
whether we should require that discardable regions are covered by
/memory.
