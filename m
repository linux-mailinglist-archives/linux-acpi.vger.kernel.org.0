It would only work if symmetric (can be locked by userspace or kernel space)
and userspace was well behaved.

Yes, but also stop the kernel from issuing requests for the duration of
a userspace request/response.  Imagine userspace issues a request for
a particular part of CDAT then kernel issues it's own request for a different
part of CDAT. Unless we can ensure the userspace request / response pair
is done, then there is no way for the kernel to verify that the response
it gets is to the request it made.  You could do some protocol specific
validation but that is horrible and you might need to read a bunch of
additional records to do it (checksum).

As currently implemented, I'm not allowing concurrent exchanges from
different protocols because it is very fiddly to do (handling the busy flag)
and I'm not convinced there is a real usecase.  Whilst in theory you can
have lots of protocols on one DOE, the protocols defined so far have had
a bunch or restrictions that mean at most you can currently collocate 2
protocols only.  If it turns out to be necessary at some future time, then
we can look at adding it.

I think the right way to do this is to put a proper interface in place
to expose the functionality to userspace via a path where mediation can
be easily handled.
