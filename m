Sure, you could make it do that with a bunch of checks on the
config being enabled, but currently I don't see the overlap in
shared code as being sufficient for that to make sense.

The discussion before was assuming that things like the acpi_map_cpu
calls might do stuff that is wanted in the make_enabled() case.

Given they don't do anything that we want there I don't see sharing
the code as useful.

I am however in favor of renaming those hotplug only calls to something
more meaningful so no one 'thinks' they may be relevant in the
enabling only case!

Jonathan

p.s. I'm smashing the outputs of the thread with Rafael into a coherent
patch set at the moment, perhaps seeing that will make it clearer what
is going on.  I got distracted by fixing numa node handling this morning
but that's now pushed out for a follow on series.
