Semantically it shouldn't really be called at this stage, but it won't 
be anyway since "to_<x>_driver(NULL)->driver_managed_dma" is not false - 
trouble is it's also not true ;)

Sure, for now this is more just an opportunistic thing - since we'll now 
expect to come through this path twice, if we see a group assigned then 
we know for sure that someone else already set up the fwspec for that to 
happen, so there's definitely nothing to do here and we can skip 
potentially waiting for iommu_probe_device_lock.

Yeah, looking at it now I'm really not sure why this ended up in this 
order - I guess I was effectively adding the dma_configure() call to the 
front of the existing iommu_fwspec_ops() check, and then I moved the 
lockdep_assert() up to make more sense. But then the ops check probably 
should have been after the group check to begin with, for much the same 
reasoning as above. I'll sort that out for v2.

Indeed, hence dev_WARN() (!= dev_warn())

Indeed I feel sufficiently confident about the ACPI path (which at the 
moment is effectively arm64-only) to remove it from there already, but 
less so about all the assorted DT platforms. That said, I guess adding a 
new dependency on dev->driver here might still represent a change of 
behaviour for the sketchy direct calls of of_dma_configure() outside bus 
code, since in a lot of those the target device doesn't actually have 
its own driver either. Maybe I need to think about this a bit more...

Thanks,
Robin.
