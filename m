That's a fair point.

Would it be better to reverse this and filter out AMD systems as they
are affected by the existing check?

Well, not necessarily.  Pre-2015 systems already worked and the check
was added as "surely, everything 2015 or newer should work either".
While it is true that putting PCIe Root Ports into D3hot was necessary
for extra energy conservation on Intel systems, it actually has been
expected to work everywhere.

Well, how would you like to deal with the systems that don't work
today, because they expect a different behavior?

Effectively, the current behavior for all modern systems is to allow
bridge D3 if there are no indications that it shouldn't be allowed.
The platforms in question assume the reverse, so what else can be
done?

Yes, because by the spec it all should work just fine.  The PCI PM 1.2
specification defines the expected behavior for bridges and the PCIe
specification claims to be a superset of that.

What we need to deal with here is basically non-compliant systems and
so we have to catch the various forms of non-compliance.

Well, it isn't in practice.
