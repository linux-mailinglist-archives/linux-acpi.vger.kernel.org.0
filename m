I'm not married to either approach but I think that you'll like the v12 
approach better.

Let me try to answer your questions anyway though because I think 
they're still applicable for understanding of this issue.

I was intentionally trying to leave the actual problem out of the commit 
from your earlier feedback and just put it in the cover letter.

But if it's better to keep in the commit message I'll return those details.

I would just say due to the platform behavior.

Yeah I see the confusion here and this is why it all ties back the 
policy that Linux uses for deciding if something can use D3hot or not.

The constraint is "not enabled" which means the OS shouldn't be putting 
the device it into a low power state.

Windows without ACPI and without the uPEP constraints saying what to do 
just leaves the device alone at suspend.  I believe that's why we get D0 
in Windows.

But Linux decides that anything >=2015 it should support D3hot, and 
anything that isn't ACPI power manageable should use D3hot.

We can't just rip that out because there are a number of Intel platforms 
that don't ship with Windows and rely upon this specific behavior to get 
the SoC into a low power state.


So what I do instead is look at the constraint not being enabled and use 
that to decide to return it to D0 at suspend.

AMD's _DSM doesn't have a public facing document today.

I'll try to get that solved, but for now referencing the Intel and 
Microsoft ones conveys the necessary message about how this stuff works.

If the consensus is to back to patching pci.c/pci-acpi.c in a future 
revision I'll change this a bit.

Yes I was relying upon PCI_POWER_ERROR for non-x86/non-s2idle cases.
