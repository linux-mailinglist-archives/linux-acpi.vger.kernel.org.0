I'm not sure about the connection between the PHAT dump in the kernel
log and pstore.

The PHAT dump would be from the time before the failure, so it is
unclear to me how useful it can be for diagnosing it.  However, after
a reboot one should be able to retrieve PHAT data from the table
directly and that may include some information regarding the failure.

With pstore, the assumption is that there will be some information
relevant for diagnosing the failure in the kernel buffer, but I'm not
sure how the PHAT dump from before the failure can help here?
