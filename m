OK. You alluded to Tianocore <-> Tianocore being your use case, which
is why I kept asking for clarification, as using a DT with this
binding seems unusual at the very least.

So coreboot does the platform init, and then hands over to Tianocore.

I take it we are not talking about x86 here, so there are no Intel FSP
blobs that may have dependencies on Tianocore/EDK2 pieces, right? So
there are no UEFI semantics in the memory descriptions that coreboot
provides to Tianocore.

So coreboot provides information to TIanocore about
- the platform topology (DT as usual)
- DRAM memory banks
- memory reservations
- secure firmware services perhaps?
- anything else?

No I mean code.

There is

https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/EmbeddedPkg/Drivers/FdtClientDxe

which encapsulates the DT received from the previous boot stage, and
exposes it as a DXE protocol.

There are other drivers that depend on this protocol, e.g., to
discover additional memory nodes, virtio-mmio drivers and PCI host
bridges.

https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/OvmfPkg/Fdt

The bindings used are the ones documented in the Linux kernel tree -
no ad-hoc bindings are being used as far as I know.

But the point I was making before re prior art was really about using
existing bindings rather than inventing new ones. Since we are now
talking about augmenting /reserved-memory, I think we're already on
the same page in this regard (with the caveat that the EDK2 code does
not actually honour /reserved-memory at this point, but this is
because none of the platforms it is being used on today uses that
node)

I do think we're converging, actually - it is just taking me some time
to get a clear mental picture of how this will be used.

It will all be under /reserved-memory, as far as I understand. We just
need to get to the right level of abstraction.
