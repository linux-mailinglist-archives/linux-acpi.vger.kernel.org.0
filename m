Apart from this, there seems to be a design issue here because it
won't notify every driver that has requested the Aux power, just the
ones that have also registered notifiers.

So this appears to be an opt-in from getting notifications on Aux
power request rejection responses to requests from other drivers
requesting Aux power for the same Root Port, but the changelog of the
first patch already claimed that the aggregation of requests was not
supported.  So if only one driver will be allowed to request the Aux
power for the given Root Port, why would the notifiers be necessary
after all?
