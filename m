I don't see how this sentence implies this. But open to suggestions on
how to reword it. I don't want to drop this line entirely though
because I'm trying to make it clear that this doesn't make a device
(that's not previously a supplier) into a supplier. It only down
grades an existing supplier to a post device initialization supplier.

Thanks! I always spend more time writing documentation and commit text

I added these two lines based on Rob's feedback. Is the indentation
that's wrong?

Yeah, I'm trying to run the dts checker, but I haven't be able to get
it to work on my end. See my email to Rob on the v1 series about this.

$ make DT_CHECKER_FLAGS=3D-m dt_binding_check

The best I could get out of it is a bunch of error reports on other
files and then:
...
<snip>/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/post-init-suppliers.yaml:
ignoring, error parsing file
...

I also tried to use DT_SCHEMA_FILES so I can only test this one file,
but that wasn't working either:

$ make DT_CHECKER_FLAGS=3D-m dt_binding_check
DT_SCHEMA_FILES=3DDocumentation/devicetree/bindings/post-init-suppliers.yam=
l
or
$ make DT_CHECKER_FLAGS=3D-m dt_binding_check DT_SCHEMA_FILES=3D<path to
the .patch file>

Results in this error early on in the output:
...
usage: yamllint [-h] [-] [-c CONFIG_FILE | -d CONFIG_DATA]
[--list-files] [-f {parsable,standard,colored,github,auto}] [-s]
[--no-warnings] [-v] [FILE_OR_DIR ...]

Yup. I'm unable to get the test to run.
