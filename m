Thanks, that does seem a little suspect.  ACPI r6.5 sec 5.6.6 says
that when OSPM handles a Bus Check, it should "perform a Plug and Play
re-enumeration operation on the device tree starting from the point
where it has been notified."

PCI devices are enumerated by doing PCI config reads.  It would make
sense to re-enumerate a PCI hierarchy starting with a PCI device
that's already known to the OS, e.g., by scanning the secondary bus of
a PCI-to-PCI bridge.

I think there are two problems here:

  1) The platform shouldn't send a Bus Check notification to a PCI
     device that doesn't exist.  How could the OS re-enumerate
     starting there?

  2) Linux runs acpiphp_hotplug_notify() for Bus Checks to
     non-existent PCI devices when it ignore them; reasoning below.

We call acpiphp_enumerate_slots() in this path, which happens before
any of the PCI devices on the root bus have been enumerated:

  pci_register_host_bridge
    pcibios_add_bus(root bus)
      acpi_pci_add_bus
        acpiphp_enumerate_slots(pci_bus *bus)
          acpi_walk_namespace(acpiphp_add_context)
            acpiphp_add_context(struct acpiphp_bridge *)
              acpi_evaluate_integer("_ADR")
              acpiphp_init_context
                context->hp.notify = acpiphp_hotplug_notify

So now we've already looked at RP03, RP07, and RP08, and set up the
.notify() handler for all of them.  Since we haven't scanned the bus
yet, we don't know that RP03 exists and RP07 and RP08 do not.

Per ACPI r6.5, sec 6, all these Device objects are "Augmented Device
Descriptors":

  An Agumented [sic] Device Descriptor, which contains additional
  device information that is not provided from the Device itself, yet
  is needed by the Device or Bus driver in order to properly configure
  and use the device. This type of device is enumerated by a
  bus-specific enumeration mechanism, and OSPM uses the Address (_ADR)
  to match the ACPI Device object in the Namespace to the device
  discovered through bus enumeration.

I think that means OSPM should discover a PCI device using the PCI
bus-specific enumeration mechanism (i.e., config reads) before it even
looks for a corresponding ACPI Device object, and it should only set
up .notify() for PCI devices that actually exist, so the Bus Checks on
RP07 and RP08 would be ignored and we wouldn't even get into the path
that causes the NULL pointer dereference:

  acpi_device_hotplug
    acpiphp_hotplug_notify              # from hp.notify
      hotplug_event
        bridge = context->bridge
        case BUS_CHECK:
          if (bridge)
            acpiphp_check_bridge
          else if (!SLOT_IS_GOING_AWAY)
            enable_slot
              bus = slot->bus           # "bus" is a root bus
              pci_assign_unassigned_bridge_resources(bus->self)
                bridge = bus->self      # "bridge" is NULL since
                                        # bus->self is NULL for root buses
                struct pci_bus *parent = bridge->subordinate
                                        # NULL pointer dereference

Obviously none of this helps solve the current regression.  Changing
the .notify() setup would be a big change, it would be risky because
it might affect dock support, and it still wouldn't fix your case 1 of
hotplug on the root bus in a virtualized environment.

This worked for me (after setting CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_ACPI=y :)):

  $ qemu-system-x86_64 -M pc -m 512M -monitor stdio -cpu host --enable-kvm -kernel arch/x86/boot/bzImage -drive format=raw,file=ubuntu.img -append "root=/dev/sda1"
  (qemu) device_add e1000

(For posterity, replacing "-monitor stdio" with "-nographic -monitor
telnet:localhost:7001,server,nowait,nodelay" and adding
"console=ttyS0,115200n8" to the -append made it easier to see the
crash details.)

I really wish we didn't have such different resource assignment paths
depending on whether the device is on a root bus or deeper in the
hierarchy.  But we can't fix that now, so this seems like the right
thing.

But would you be OK with this minor mod?

      if (pci_is_root_bus(bus))
        __pci_bus_size_bridges(dev->subordinate, &add_list);

  ...

  if (pci_is_root_bus(bus))
    __pci_bus_assign_resources(bus, &add_list, NULL);
  else
    pci_assign_unassigned_bridge_resources(bus->self);

For two reasons: (1) test the same condition both places, and (2) be a
little more explicit about the scenario (and "bus->self == NULL" also
happens for the virtual buses added for SR-IOV).
