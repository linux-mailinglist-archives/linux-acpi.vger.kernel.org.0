Rev 5 in the ECN isn't compatible with rev 6 in the PCI FW r3.3 spec,
so it doesn't follow the ACPI compatibility requirement.  And this is
documented in PCI FW, which says "Fn 0xC was added with rev 5 (see ECN
for rev 5 details); here is how rev 6 works."

An OS implemented to the ECN doesn't know that rev 6 is different from
rev 5; it assumes they're the same because ACPI says we can assume
that, and PCI FW r3.3 even says the OS should use the same rev for all
functions.  If OS adds support for rev 6 of a some other function, it
is supposed to use rev 6 of Fn 0xC, which doesn't work as the OS
expects.

I guess one could argue that "OS didn't add rev 6 support for anything
until PCI FW r3.3 added a function at rev 6, r3.3 did mention the
difference between Fn 0xC rev 5 and 6, and OS should have looked at
all the already-implemented unrelated functions for possible changes
between rev 5 and rev 6."

I think that causes unnecessary changes in unrelated code.  The OS can
avoid the problem by *always* using Fn 0xC rev 5, regardless of what
rev it uses for other functions.

Of course, the OS can include support for multiple revs, e.g., it
could add support for Fn 0xC rev 6 and use that when available.  And
it could retain support for Fn 0xC rev 5 and use that if rev 6 isn't
available.
