Thanks for the clarify, for CCA attributes, child device should be the
same as its parent and that was written in the ACPI spec, so it's better
to make it clear for other properties in the spec as well.

As I said in previous email, I'm not against this patch, and seems
have no regressions for platforms that using named component node
such as D05/D06 (I will test it shortly to make sure), but it's better
to update the wording of the spec (even after this patch set is merged).

Thanks
