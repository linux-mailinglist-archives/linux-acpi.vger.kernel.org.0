I've trimmed the rest of your response as it wasn't especially constructive.
Please can you try to keep things civil, even when you're frustrated? It's
not very pleasant being on the end of a rant.

One likely explanation for you not getting a reply on your patches is that
I've discovered many of your emails have ended up in my spam, for some
reason. I'm using gmail for my inbox so, if Bjorn is doing that as well,
then there's a good chance he hasn't seen them either.

The other thing to keep in mind is that the 5.16 merge window opened today
and you posted the latest version of your patches on Wednesday. That doesn't
really leave enough time for the patches to be reviewed (noting that patch 3
is new in this version and the kernel build robot was still complaining on
Friday), queued and put into linux-next, so I would suspect that this series
is looking more like 5.17 material and therefore not a priority for
maintainers at the moment.

Your best is probably to post a v5, with the kbuild warnings addressed,
when -rc1 is released in a couple of weeks. I'm not sure how to fix the
spam issue though :(

Will
