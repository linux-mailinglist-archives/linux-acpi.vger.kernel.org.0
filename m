This text about Type 2 records in ACPI r6.6, sec 6.2.10.3, seems a
little ambiguous to me:

  A PCI Express-aware OS that has assumed ownership of native hot plug
  (via _OSC) but does not support or does not have ownership of the
  AER register set must use the data values returned by the _HPX
  object’s Type 2 record to program the AER registers of a hot-added
  PCI Express device. However, since the Type 2 record also includes
  register bits that have functions other than AER, OSPM must ignore
  values contained within this setting record that are not applicable.

If I squint, I can read that as meaning that Type 2 is really there
just for AER, and the OS:

  - should only use a Type 2 record when it owns PCIe native hotplug
    (native_pcie_hotplug) but does not own AER (!native_aer),

  - should only program AER registers, and

  - should *ignore* bits unrelated to AER.

Most of the registers in Type 2 are in the AER Capability.  Device
Control is in the PCIe Capability, but if _OSC has granted AER
ownership to the OS, that includes the Error Reporting Enable bits in
Device Control (there's a PCI Firmware spec ECN to this effect:
https://members.pcisig.com/wg/Firmware/document/20514).

Type 2 does include Link Control, which is in the PCIe Capability and
doesn't seem related to AER, so maybe I'm on the wrong track.  But if
Type 2 was intended to handle things *other* than AER, I would think
the PCIe Capability Slot Control and Root Control would have been
included.

So *maybe* program_hpx_type2() should mask out everything from
pci_exp_devctl_or except PCI_EXP_DEVCTL_CERE, PCI_EXP_DEVCTL_NFERE,
PCI_EXP_DEVCTL_FERE, and PCI_EXP_DEVCTL_URRE?  I have no idea what we
would do with Link Control though.

I wish I knew the history of this, but I don't.
