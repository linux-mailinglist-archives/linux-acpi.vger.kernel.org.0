Hi Stanislav,

Thanks for doing this!

Also when CRSV is enabled, config read that doesn't cover VENDOR is 
also retried automatically.

I like this check to read VENDOR_ID when crssv is enabled. But your patches
seems to define in patch13 and used in patch16?

can we keep them simple? and if possible just this would be a 
needed fix. We have some systems that we have found can cause
timeouts if CRSV is enabled, but you read any other register
other than the PCI_VENDOR.

Would prefer to see this fix before the other cleanups can stabilize :-)

I would also mark that for stable.
